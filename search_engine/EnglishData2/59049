there is no convincing evidence that such a disease exists there s a lot of evidence it just hasn t been adequately gathered an published in a way that will convince the die hard melancholic skeptic who quiver everytime the word anecdote or empirical is usedsnort ah there go my sinuses again for example dr ivker who wrote the book sinus survival always givesoh wow a classic textbook hey they laughed at einstein too before any other treatment a systemic anti fungal such as nizoral to hi new patients if they ve been on braod spectrum anti biotics 4 or more time in the last two years he s kept a record of the results and for over 2000 patients found that over 90 of his patients get significant relie of allergic sinus symptoms of course this is only the beginning for hi programyeah i ll bet tomorrow the worldlisten uncontrolled studies like this are worthless in my case as i reported a few weeks ago i was developing the classi symptoms outlined in the yeast connection i agree it is a poorly written book e g extreme sensitivity to plastics vapors etc whic i never had before started in november within one week of full dosag of sporanox the sensitivity to chemicals has fully disappeared i ca now sit on my couch at home without dying after two minutes i m als greatly improved in other areas as welli m sure you are you sound like the typical hysteric hypochondriac whresponds to miracle cures of course i have allergy symptoms etc i am especially allergic t molds yeasts etc it doesn t take a rocket scientist to figure out tha if one has excessive colonization of yeast in the body and you have natural allergy to yeasts that a threshold would be reached where yo would have perceptible symptomsyeah it makes sense to me so of course it should be taken seriouslysnort also yeast do produce toxins of variou sorts and again you don t have to be a rocket scientist to realize tha such toxins can cause problems in some peopleyeah it sounds reasonable to me of course the 60 00 question is whether a person who is immune compromised as tests showed i wa from over 5 years of antibiotics nutritionally deficiencies because of th stress of infections and allergies etc oh really what tests immune compromised my assmore like credulous malingerer this is a psychiatric syndrome can develop excessive yeas colonization somewhere in the body it is a tough question to answer sinc testing for excessive yeast colonization is not easy one almost has t take an empirical approach to diagnosis fortunately sporanox is relativel safe unlike past anti fungals still have to be careful however so there no reason any longer to withhold sporanox treatment for empirical reasonsyou know it s a shame that a drug like itraconazole is being misusein this way it s ridiculously expensive and potentially toxicthe trouble is that it isn t toxic enough so it gets abused by quacks btw some would say to try nystatin unfortunately most yeast grows hypha too deep into tissue for nystatin to have any permanent affect you ll fin a lot of people who are on nystatin all the timethe only good thing about nystatin is that it s relatively cheaand when taken orally non toxic but oral nystatin is without ansystemic effect so unless it were given iv it would be withouany effect on your sinuses i wish these quacks would first usiv nystatin or amphotericin b on people like you that would solvthe yeast problem once and for all in summary i appreciate all of the attempts by those who desire to kee medicine on the right road but methinks that some who hold too firml to the party line are academics who haven t been in the trenches long enoug actually treating patients if anybody doctors included said to me to m face that there is no evidence of the yeast connection i cannot guarante their safety for their incompetence ripping off their lips is justified a far as i am concernedperhaps a little haldol would go a long way towards amelioratinyour symptomsare you paying for this treatment out of your own pocket i d hatto think my insurance premiums are going towards this steve dyedyer ursa major spdcc com aka ima harvard rayssd linus m2c spdcc dye
