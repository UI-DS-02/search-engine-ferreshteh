mmm cup portal com mark robert thorson writes i don t understand the assumption that because something is found t be carcinogenic that it would not be legal in the u s i think tha no there is something called the delany amendment which makes carcinogeni food additives illegal in any amount this was passed by congress in th 1950 s before stuff like mass spectrometry became available which increase detectable levels of substances by a couple orders of magnitude this is why things like cyclamates and red 2 were banned they are ver weakly carcinogenic in huge quantities in rats so under the act they ar banned this also applies to natural carcinogens some of you might remember time back in the 1960 s when root beer suddenly stopped tasting so good and never tasted so good again that was the time when safrole was banned this is the active flavoring ingredient in sassafras leaves if it were possible to market a root beer good like the old days someon would do it in order to make money the fact that no one does it indicate that enforcement is still in effect an odd exception to the rule seems to be the product known as gumbo file this is nothing more than coarsely ground dried sassafras leaves thi is not only a natural product but a natural product still in its natura form so maybe that s how they evade delany or maybe a special exemptio was made to appease powerful louisiana democratsi think what we have to keep in mind is that even though it may be illegal tcommercially produce sell food with carcinogenic substances it is not illegafor people to do such to their own food smoking etc is this true
