rehoffman md state epidemiologist colorado dept of health jm douglas md denver dept of health and hospitals surveillance and information systems br div of sexually transmitted diseases and hiv prevention national center forprevention svcs cdc editorial note the increase in reported gonorrhea cases in colorado in 1992may represent an overall increase in the occurrence of this disease or morecomplete reporting stimulated by visitations to laboratories by cdhsurveillance staff during 1991 1992 the increases in confirmed gonorrheacases at dmhc and in culture positivity rates in three of four laboratoriessuggest a real increase in gonorrhea rather than a reporting artifact however the stable culture positivity rate in the nonprofit family planninglaboratory which serves a network of clinics statewide indicates that thegonorrhea increase did not uniformly affect all segments of the population one possible explanation for the increased occurrence of gonorrhea incolorado may be gang and drug related sexual behavior as implicated in arecent outbreak of drug resistant gonorrhea and other stds in colorado springs 2 although the high morbidity census tracts in the denver metropolitan areacoincide with areas of gang and drug activity this hypothesis requiresfurther assessment to examine the possible role of drug use implicatedpreviously as a factor contributing to the national increase in syphilis 3 6 the cdh std aids program is collecting information from all persons in whomgonorrhea is diagnosed regarding drug use exchange of sex for money or drugs and gang affiliation

8 reported by national center for injury prevention and control nationalcenter for chronic disease prevention and health promotion cdc editorial note the findings in this report are consistent with othersindicating that adults who do not use safety belts themselves are less likelyto employ occupant restraints for their children 6 9 because thesenonbelted adults are at increased risk of crashing and more likely to exhibitother risk taking behaviors children traveling with them may be at greaterrisk for motor vehicle injury 10 educational attainment of adult respondents was inversely associated withchild restraint use in this report accordingly occupant protection programsshould be promoted among parents with low educational attainment because loweducational attainment is often associated with low socioeconomic status suchprograms should be offered to adults through health care facilities that servelow income communities or through federal programs i e head start that

donot have mandatory safety belt use laws should be encouraged to wear safetybelts and to protect their children by using approved child safety seats andsafety belts finally the increased use of restraints among children mayincrease their likelihood of using safety belts when they become teenagers the age group characterized by the lowest rate of safety belt use and thehighest rate of fatal

populationbased surveillance systems that employ similar data collection methods theprevalence estimates for 44 diagnostic categories were based on data for 19831988 for 639 837 births in california

prevalence of aortic stenosis fetalalcohol syndrome hip dislocation dysplasia microcephalus obstruction of thekidney ureter and scoliosis lordosis may be attributable to generaldiagnostic variability however differences in the prevalences of arm handlimb reduction encephalocele spina bifida or trisomy 21 down syndrome areprobably not attributable to differences in ascertainment because thesedefects are relatively easy to diagnose interpretation regional differences in prenatal diagnosis and pregnancytermination may affect prevalences of trisomy 21 and spina bifida however the reason for differences in arm hand reduction is unknown but may berelated to variability in environmental exposure heterogeneity in the genepool or random variation actions taken because of the similarities of these data bases severalcollaborative studies are being implemented in particular the differences inthe birth prevalence of spina bifida and down syndrome will focus attention onthe impact of

arizon health sciences center copyright 1993 the university of arizon high tech assisted reproductive technologiefollowing the birth of the first in vitro fertilization embryo transfer ivfet baby in 1978 a host of assisted reproductive technologies have beendeveloped that include ivf et gamete intrafallopian tube transfer gift embryo cryopreservation freezing and gamete micromanipulation together these technologies are referred to as the high tech assisted reproductivetechnology art procedures ovulation induction sperm insemination and surgery for tubal disease and orpathology still are the mainstays of the therapies available for infertilitymanagement however when these fail it almost always is appropriate toproceed with one of the art procedures therefore in addition to a comprehensive basic and general infertilityservice at the university of arizona center for reproductive endocrinology andinfertility there is a program of assisted reproduction that specializes inart procedures this program serves as a tertiary provider for those patientsin the state of arizona whose infertility problems cannot be resolved by thetraditional therapies the following article on back describes the art procedures available in ourcenter clarifies appropriate applications for each and considers therealistic expectations for their success procedures included are o in vitroo fertilization embryo transfer ivf et gamete intrafallopian tube transfero gift cryopreservation of human embryos and gamete micromanipulation this article also considers ongoing research in our program that is directedtowards improved success of these technologies hicnet medical newsletter page 2volume 6 number 10 april 20 199 future areas of researcin addition to ongoing research that is directed exclusively toward themanagement of infertile couples we are developing the technology to assistcouples who are at risk for producing embryos with a serious hereditarydisease this technology involves biopsying the preimplantation human embryo and thensubjecting the biopsied cells to genetic analysis using either dnaamplification or fluorescent in situ hybridization there are recent reports of the successful application of dna amplification byother centers for example for diagnosis of the genes for cystic fibrosis andhemophilia we hope to apply and further focus fluorescent in situhybridization technology for probing the x chromosome the identification ofwhich will provide a scientific basis for counselling patients who exhibitsex linked disorders the considerable clinical application of such technology lies in the fact thatit circumvents the need for prenatal diagnosis in addition to the possibilityof a subsequent termination of affected fetuses in order to avoid the birthof affected

transfer is the core art procedure of ourassisted reproduction program this procedure involves retrieval ofunfertilized eggs from the ovary their insemination in vitro in a dish andthe culture of resultant embryos for 1 or 2 days before they are transferredto the patient s uterus all cultures are maintained in an incubator understrictly controlled atmospheric and temperature conditions before beingprocessed for use in insemination semen samples are evaluated in ourandrology laboratory using both subjective light microscopy and computerhicnet medical newsletter page 2volume 6 number 10 april 20 199assisted semen analyses to ensure an adequate number of eggs with which toperform ivf et or indeed gift follicular development is typicallystimulated with gonadotropins perganol metrodin gonadotropin releasinghormone gnrh factrel lutrepulse and or gnrh analogues lupron depolupron synarel occasionally however ivf et is accomplished with eggsobtained in non stimulated cycles while some programs utilize laparoscopicegg retrieval in the operating room with the patient under general anesthesia we undertake the less costly approach of ultrasound guided retrieval in ourinfertility unit with the patient sedated couples who resort to ivf et exhibit such pathologies as tubaldeficiencies ovulatory dysfunction endometriosis and or mild forms of malefactor infertility according to the united states ivf registry the overallsuccess rate for ivf et nationwide has stabilized at about 14 percent percycle results from our program involving 86 patients who have undergone 173ivf et cycles reflect a comparable success rate nevertheless the overall incidence of success with this procedure isdisconcertingly low and emphasizes the need to address those physiologicalfactors that limit achievement of a higher percentage of pregnancies wellrecognized predictors of outcome include patient age response to exogenousovarian stimulation quality of sperm and number of repeated ivf et cycleattempts however among these age is the single most significant determinantof conception therefore it is critical that such patients are referred to anassisted reproduction program at the earliest opportunity following failure oftraditional therapies the underlying basis for the negative effect of age on fertility has notbeen clearly delineated beyond recognition that 1 the number of eggsavailable for retrieval declines markedly with age 2 fertilization ratessignificantly decrease in eggs retrieved from patients who are over 40 years and 3 provided the appropriate hormonal background is present age isunrelated to uterine competency to sustain pregnancy ongoing research in ourcenter therefore is investigating physiological changes in the egg that maybe impacted by age we have determined that more than 50 percent of eggs thatfail to fertilize in vitro are chromosomally abnormal and that a significantproportion of these abnormalities are accountable to patient age currently the only recourse for such patients is to use eggs obtained from a donor ourprogram has initiated recruitment of volunteer egg donors to satisfy the needsof a list of recipients interested in this form of therapy gift this high tech art procedure is performed in the operating room usually with the use of a laparoscope and in contrast to ivf et involvesintroducing sperm and freshly retrieved eggs into the lumen of the fallopiantube an average of 3 eggs tube under these circumstances fertilizationoccurs in vivo and if excess eggs are retrieved the remainder undergo ivf with subsequent options for embryo transfer in that cycle or freezing fortransfer in a subsequent cycle this art procedure is applied to cases inhicnet medical newsletter page 2volume 6 number 10 april 20 199which there is at least one patent fallopian tube but the couple has suchpathologies as ovulatory dysfunction endometriosis male factor infertilityand or idiopathic infertility the data reported in the united states ivf registry for 1985 through 1990indicate that the overall success rate with gift is higher than that obtainedwith the ivf et technique range of clinical pregnancies for gift is 24 to 36percent and for ivf et 14 to 18 percent in view of this fact one mightexpect more patients to be treated with gift than ivf et however in ourprogram we have taken into account three basic concerns which whilesubstantially reducing the number of gift cycles performed benefit thepatient these concerns are 1 the increased costs associated with performinga procedure in the operating room 2 the risks albeit minimal of undergoinggeneral anesthesia and 3 the considerable benefits to be accrued fromobtaining direct information on the quality and fertilizability of the eggs and the developmental competency of resultant embryos the increased success with gift undoubtedly reflects the artificialenvironment provided by the laboratory in the ivf et procedure betweenjanuary 1 1991 and december 31 1992 we have performed a total of 12 giftcycles with an overall success rate of 20 percent embryo cryopreservation or freezing is applied in our program whenembryos result from residual gift eggs or from non transferred ivf embryos this procedure not only provides patients with a subsequent opportunity forsuccess at much reduced costs but also circumvents the legal and ethicalissues relating to disposal of supernumerary embryos therefore as stipulatedby the american fertility society ethical guidelines for art programs fromboth a practical and an ethical standpoint all assisted reproduction programsshould have the capability of cryopreserving human embrys gamete micromanipulation this art procedure which is still very new is applied to couples who are unaccepting of insemination with donor semen butwho have severe male factor infertility less than 10 million sperm ml incombination with fewer than 20 perccent motile sperm and or less than 10percent sperm with normal morphology we are currently developing theprocedure of sub zonal insertion szi which entails injecting sperm underthe coating around the egg the barrier normally penetrated by the spermthrough enzymatic digestion available data from szi programs world wide indicate that only 5 to 10percent of szi cycles result in a pregnancy this statistic undoubtedlyrelates to limitations imposed by abnormalities inherent in the sperm therefore we are currently focusing on the development of improved techniquesfor the recognition and selection of sperm chosen for manipulation suchefforts are unquestionably worthwhile in view of the fact that this technologyoffers the only realistic opportunity for severe male factor patients toestablish conception catherine racowsky ph
