ihave had a frozen shoulder for over a year or about a year it is stil partially frozen and i am still in physical therapy every week but th pain has subsided almost completely until last week when i mowed th lawn for twenty minutes each two days in a row i have a push type powe mower the pain started back up a little bit for the first time in quit a while and i used ice and medicine again can anybody explain why thi particular activity which does not seem to stress me very much generally should cause this shoulder problemyou need to use your shoulder muscles to push the mower if you haven t beedoing much exercise as i suppose you haven t then a constant 20 minutlong effort can cause stiffness and cramps philipp
