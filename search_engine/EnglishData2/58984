there has been no hard info provided about msg making people illthats the point after allwhy dont you just look it up in the merk or check out the medical dictionarcite which a doctor mentioned earlier in this threadthats because these peerreviewed studies are not addressinthe effects of msg in people theyre looking at animal modelsyou cant walk away from this and start ranting about gloom andoom as if there were any documented deleterious health effectdemonstrated in humans note that i wouldnt have any argumenwith a statement like noting that animal administration has produced the following blah blah we must be careful about ituse in humans this is precisely not what you saidamong others see olneys excitotoxic food aditives relevance oanimal studies to human safety 1982 neurobehav toxicol teratolvol 6 455462im sure peta would love to hear your argumentstests have been done on rhesus monkeys as well i have never seen study where the mode of administration was intraventricular the gland asp were administered orally some studies used iv and scintraventricular is not a normal admin method for food tox studiesfor obvious reasons you must not have read the peerreviewed workthat i referred to or you would never have come up with this braiinjection bunkit most certainly is for neurotoxicology you know studies oglutamate involve more than food sciencewhose talking about food science what is this comment supposed tmean neurotoxicology and tratology brain research natureprogress in brain research all fine food science journals pardon me but where are you getting this from have you read thjournals have you done a thorough literature searchso point us to the studies in humans please im familiar witthe literature and ive never seen any which relate at all tolneys work in animals and the effects of glutamate on neuronsthen you would know that olney himself has casually referred tchinese restaurant syndrome in a few articles why dont you poinus to some studies maybe then this exchange could be productivethe point is exceeding the window of course theyre amino acidsnote that people with pku cannot tolerate any phenylalaninewell actually they have to tolerate some phenylalanine its essential amino acid they just try to get as little as is healthwithout producing dangerous levels of phenylalanine and its metabolitein the bloodtheyre unable to metabolise itolneys research compared infant human diets specifically the amounof freely available glu in mothers milk versus commercial baby foodsvs typical lunch items from the standard american diet such as packagesoup mixes he found that one could exceed the projected safety margifor infant humans by at least fourfold in a single meal of processefoods mothers milk was well below the effective dosegoodness im not saying that its good to feed infants a lot oglutamatesupplemented foods its just that this projected safetmargin is a construct derived from animal models and given thatyou can prove anything you like were talking prudent policy iinfant nutrition here yet youre misrepresenting it as received wisdomwho said anything about received wisdom there is no question thaorally administered doses of msg are capable of destroying nearly alneurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and the mediaeminence these areas are responsible for the production ohormones critical to normal neuroendocrine function and the normadevelopment of the vertabrate organism humans are vertebrates nowhat pray tell do you think will happen when the area of the brainecessary for the normal rhythm of gonadotropin release is missingare you trying to say that humans have no need of their pituitaryanh and me of that part of the brain that is responsible focontrolling the realease albeit indirectly of estradiol and testosteronehow do you expect anyone to do the studies on this its unethical tsacrifice humans to check out what effects chronic acute etc doseof these compounds are having on the brain tissue in humans the fooindustry knows this thats why the animal model is used in medicinand psych if youre talking about straight sensitivity it would buseful to define the term there are plenty of studies opsychoneuroimmunology showing the link between attitude anphysiologyi suspect we may be arguing about separate things only adult sensitivitieyou and lateoccuring sequelae of childhood ingestion and itimplication for adults me certainlthe doses for excitotoxicity in adults are considerably larger thafor the young but the additivity of glu and asp and their copiouand increased presence in modern processed foods jointly and theihidden presence in hvp necessitates extreme caution why would anyonwant to eat compounds which have been shown to markedly perturb thendocrine system in adults the main point is blood levelsattained and oral doses would likely have to be greater than scbetween who over what i would be most interested in seeing yoprovide peerreviewed nonfoodindustryfunded citations to articledisputing that msg has no effects whatsoeveryou mean asserting youre being intellectually dishonest or jusplain confused because youre conflating reports which do not necessarilhave anything to do with each other olneys reports would argue a potentiafor problems in human infants but thats not to say that this says anythinwhatsoever about the use of msg in most foods nor does he provide anstudies in humans which indicate any deleterious effects for obvioureasons it says nothing about msgs contribtion to the phenomenoof the chinese restaurant syndrome it says nothing about the frequeninability to replicate anecdotal reports of msg sensitivity in the labolneys work provides a putative causal mechanism for somsensitivities terry epelbaum and martin have shown that oralladministered msg causes changes in normal gonadotropic hormonfluctutations in adults glu also was found to induce immediate and persistansupression of rhythmic gh secretion and to induce rapid and transienrelease of prolactin in adults chronically exposed to msg gh iresponsible not only for control of growth during development bualso converts glycogen into
