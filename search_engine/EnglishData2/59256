these are my last words on the subjecfrom lundbyrtsgmotcom walter f lundby writes as a person who is very sensitive to msg and whose wife and kids ar too i want to know why the food industry wants to put msg in foodsome people think it enhances the flavor i personally dont think ihelps the taste it makes me sick so i try to avoid it from dyerspdcccom steve dyer writes sez you such an effect in humans has not been demonstrated in an controlled studies infant mice and other models are useful as fa as they go but theyre not relevant to the matter at hand which i not to say that i favor its use in things like baby fooda patentl ridiculous use of the additive but we have no reason to believ that msg in the diet effects humans adverselywell i know that msg effects me adversely maybe not permanently buat least temporarily enough that i like to try to avoid the stuff from kiranvillagecom kiran wagle writes if you dont like additives then for godsake get off the net and learn to cook from scratch sheeshexcuse mewhy cant people learn to cook from scratch on the net ive gottelots of recipes off the net that dont use additivesif you like additives then get off the net and go to your locasupermarket buy lots of packaged foods and you get off the net is it to cover up the fact that the recipes are not very good or the food is poor quality yes and you buy it says something about your taste ehi dont and what happens when the companies forced to submit to your silly notion go out of business because nobody wants to buy their overpriced bad food removing preservatives directly raises food costs by reducing shelf lifehey ill pay my hard earned dollars to buy food that costs morbut does not have preservatives i choose to speak with my pocketbooin many ways from kiranvillagecom kiran wagle you have a good point msg is commonly used in soups in bottle sauces in seasoning mixtures and in the coating on barbecue potat chips nacho cheese doritos breading for many frozen fried foods like fisand chicken etc ad naseum if msg is really the problem we should call this barbecue potat chip syndrome or maybe diner syndrome or the and other natural flavorings syndrome its been a few yearsince ive bought anything labelled with and other naturaflavorings from kiranvillagecom kiran wagle the reaction came the time the msg was in the foo that was the only differenc same restaurant same ingredients how do you know this in order to demonstrate your claim you would have had to supervise th preparation on both occasions perhaps they used msg both times and lie about it perhaps once they used something that had begun to spoil an produced some bizarre toxin that youre allergic towell i had had similar reactions many times that was when i reallstarted watching carefully reaction to doritos hey guess whats ithere reaction to lawrys season salt guess whats in therill give you a hint ive had enough problems with many many mandifferent products with msg that i figured out one thingunless i plan on getting sick i wont eat the stuff without mseldane and did i ever learn to read labels please note that i am not saying you are making it up i am jus trying to point out that the situation is not always as simple as i might seem which was why i started checking every time i got sick and evertime i got sick msg was somehow involved in one of the food productsand consider there were no other similar ingredients to my knowledge it might not please a medical researcher but it pleased my owpersonal physician enough for him to give me allergy medicine and mosimportantly its enough proof for me to avoid it and enough proothat my incredibly frugal fiance didnt flinch when i literally threout or gave away all the food products in his pantry that had msg and he always flinches when theres waste but it was a simplexplanation i wont eat this stuff i wont cook with this stuff si can either throw it out or give it away from patteeucsucoloradoedu donna pattee my guess was that the spice mix on the fries contained msgprobably lawrys seasoning salt i love the way that tastes im not saying i never consume anything with msg ive noticed that have a certain tolerance level like a small bag of bbq chips onca month or so it not a problem but that same bag of chips wilbother me if i also had chicken bouillon yesterday and lunch at one othe chinese restaurants the day before from kelleyhealthyuwaterlooca catherine l kelley all thats needed now is that final step a doubleblind study don on humans there isnt even an ethical question about possibl harm as this is a widely used and approved food additivebut some say that only 2 of the population has a problem with msg some say its more like 20 but lets say that its 5 how manpeople would have to be tested that would have a problem also know i have a problem with it and i wouldnt volunteer for a testlike thanks guys but i dont want to get sick also im sure thamost people probably have varying degrees of sensitivities adifferent times if i have a cold im much more susceptible to threaction than when im healthy as proven today when im stuffy bufor some silly reason i still gave in and decided to have the bbchips from kiranvillagecom kiran wagle because too many of you generic rhetorical you not you cathy g around calling this chinese restaurant syndrome thus suggesting to th people you complain to that you experience this only from chinese food msg is prevalent in a lot more things than chinese foodthats why suggested calling this diner syndrome cathy doesnt i havent saved all my postings but i never called ichinese restaurant syndrome and i never stated i got it only frochinese food i just thought it would be easiest to conduct mpersonal test at a chinese take out place that i knew would hold onot hold the msg i cant call up whoever makes doritos and ask theto make me one back of chips without msg on the other hand if one complains about potatoes from a mix o restaurant spice mixes im going to believe them and if anyone says the got msgsick after eating too many barbecue potato chips at a party i really going to believe them well i believe i mentioned that in an earlier postlets see you wrote this message adate 20 apr 1993 000931 050but ondate 19 apr 1993 163318 gmi wrote has anyone had an msg reaction from something other than chinese restaurant lots of times thats why it was so hard for me to pin down would probably have been easier if id only have the reaction in certain type of restaurant but ive had the reaction in chines restaurants and greek restaurants and italian restaurants and stea places i can tell you when a steak joint uses accent to tenderiz their meat oh and just in case anyone thinks im prejudice against eithechinese food or asian people im not going home to cook some chinesfood for the guy im marrying next week incidentally his last namis wuso stop it with the flame maiwhy does a woman work ten years to change a mans
