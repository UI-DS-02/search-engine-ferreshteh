enea1 applelink apple com horace enea writes can anyone out there tell me the difference between a persistent diseas and a chronic one for example persistent hepatitis vs chroni hepatitis i don t think there is a general distinction rather there ar two classes of chronic hepatitis chronic active hepatitis and chroni persistent hepatitis i can t think of any other disease where th term persistent is used with or in preference to chronic much as these two terms chronic active and chronic persistent sound fuzzy the actual distinction between the two condition is often fairly fuzzy as well i beg to differ chronic active hepatitis implies that the diseas remains active and generally leads to liver failure at the ver minimum the patient has persistently elevated liver enzymes what som call transaminitis chronic persistant hepatitis simply means tha the patient has hbsag in his her blood and can transmit the infection bu shows no evidence of progressive disease if i had to choose i d muc rather have the persistant typebeing a chronic hbsag carrier does not necessarily mean the patient has chronipersistent anything persons who are chronic carriers may have no clinicalbiochemical or histologic evidence of liver disease or they may have chronipersistent hepatitis chronic active hepatitis cirrhosis or hepatocellulacarcinomamost cases of chronic persistent hepatitis cph are probably the result oa viral infection although in a good number of cases the cause cannot bdetermined the diagnosis of cph is made on the basis of liver biopsy iconsists of findings of portal inflammation an intact periportal limitinplate and on occasion isolated foci of intralobular necrosis but in contrasto chronic active hepatitis cah there is no periportal inflammation bridging necrosis or fibrosis cph has indeed an excellent prognosis if i had to choose between cah ancph there is no question i would also choose cph however as david pointeout the distinction between the two is not as neat as some of us would havit the histology can sometimes be pretty equivocal with biopsies showinareas compatible with both cph and cah maybe it is a sampling problem maybit is a continuum i don t know howard doyldoyle pitt ed
