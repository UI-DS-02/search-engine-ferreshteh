the following is based on copies i was given of some articles published ihearing instruments i would appreciate any comments about this and othenew technology for hearing aidsthe resound system was developed on the basis of some research at att anappears to take a different approach from other aids it appears to me thaa new programmable aid like the widex just uses a more flexible anprogrammable version of the classical approach of amplifying some parts othe spectrum more than others and adding some compression to try and helout in noisy situationsthe major difference in the resound approach is that it divides thspectrum into low and high frequencies splitting point is programmableapparently based on the fact that lots of vowel information can be found ithe low frequencies while the important consonant informatiounfortunately for me is in the high frequencies the two bands then artreated with different compression schemes which are programable they havalso developed a new fitting algorythm that builds on what they calabnormal growth of loudnessthis latter is interesting and fits my own personal experience though think the phrase is missleading what appears to be the case is that as yoexceed the minimum threshold for a person with hearing loss the deficibecomes progresslively less compared to normals and by the time you reacthe too loud point the sensitivity curves appear to converge this meanthat if you just boost all sound levels you are overloading at the higend for people with hearing losses hence what you want is progressivelless amplification as the signal get closer to the maximum tolerable pointyou want to boost low volume sounds more than high and do so potentialldifferently for the low and high frequency parts of the spectrum speciallfor someone like me who is relatively normal up to 1000 cps and then falloff a cliffaids with simple compressors dont descriminate between energy in the loand high frequencies and can therefor compress useful high frequencinformation because of high volume of low frequency componentsparticularly impressive was the resound performance with whispered speecand in simulated restaurant noise situationsrich haller rhallernsuoregonedu university of oregon eugene orus
