banschbach vms ocom okstate edu writes to candida blooms following the use of broad spectrum antibiotics gorden rubenfeld through e mail has assured me that most physicians recognize the chance of candida blooms occuring after broad spectrum antibiotic use and they therefore reinnoculate their patients with good bacteria to restore competetion for candida in the body i do not believe that this is yet a standard part of medical practice nor is it mine what i tried to explain to marty was that it is clearl understood that antibiotic exposure is a risk factor for fungal infection which is not the same as saying bacteria prevent fungal infections marty made this sound like a secret known only to veternarians an biochemists anyone who has treated a urinary tract infection known this at some centers pre op liver transplant patients receive bowe decontamination directed at retaining good anaerobic flora in an attemp to prevent fungal colonization in this soon to be high risk group i als use lactobacillus to treat enteral nutrition associated diarrhea that ma be in part due to alterations in gut flora however it is not part o my routine practice to reinnoculate patients with good bacteria afte antibiotics i have seen no data on this practice preventing or treatin fungal infections in at risk patients whether or not it is a logica extension from the available observations i ll leave to those of you wh base strong opinions and argue over such speculations in the absence o clinical trials one place such therapy has been described is in treating particularl recalcitrant cases of c difficile colitis not a fungal infection ther are case reports of using stool ie someone elses enemas to repopulat the patients flora don t try this at home not give give her advise to use the otc anti fungal creams since candida colonizes primarily in the ano rectal area gi symptoms should be more common than vaginal problems after broad spectrum antibiotic use except that it isn t at least symptomatically apparent disease medicine has not and probalby never will be practiced this way there has always been the use of conventional wisdom a very good example is kidney stones conventional wisdom because clinical trails have not been done to come up with an effective prevention was that restricitng the intake of calcium and oxalates was the best way to prevent kidney stones from forming clinical trials focused on drugs or ultrasonic blasts to breakdown the stone once it formed through the recent new england j of medicine article we now know that conventional wisdom was wrong increasing calcium intake is better at preventing stone formation than is restricting calcium intake seems like this is an excellent argument for ignoring anecdota conventional wisdom a euphemism for no data and doing a good clinica trial like au dismukes w e wade j s lee j y dockery b k hain j d ti a randomized double blind trial of nystatin therapy for th candidiasis hypersensitivity syndrome see comments so n engl j med 1990 dec 20 323 25 p 1717 23 psychological tests results the three active treatment regimen and the all placebo regime significantly reduced both vaginal and systemic symptoms p less tha 0 001 but nystatin did not reduce the systemic symptom significantly more than placebo conclusions in women with presumed candidiasi hypersensitivity syndrome nystatin does not reduce systemic o psychological symptoms significantly more than placebo consequently the empirical recommendation of long term nystatin therapy for suc women appears to be unwarranted does this trial address every issue raised here no jon noring was no surprised at this negative trial since they didn t use sporanox despit crook s recommendation for nystatin maybe they didn t avoid thos carbohydrates the conventional wisdom in animal husbandry has been that animals need to be reinnoculated with good bacteria after coming off antibiotic therapy if it makes sense for livestock why doesn t it make sense for humans david we are not talking about a dangerous treatment unless you consider yogurt dangerous if this were a standard part of medical practice as gordon r says it is then the incidence of gi distress and vaginal yeast infections should decline marty you ve also changed the terrain of the discussion from empiri itraconazole for undocumented chronic fungal sinusitis with systemi hypersensitivity symptoms noring syndrome to the yoghurt and vitami therapy of undocumented candida enteritis elaine palmer syndrome wit systemic symptoms there is significant difference between the cost an risk of these two empiric therapeutic trials are we talking about real candida infections the whole yeast connection hypothesis the efficac of routine bacterial repopulation in humans or the ability of anecdotall effective therapies challenged by a negative randomized trial to confir an etiologic hypothesis post hoc ergo propter hoc we can t seem t focus in on a disease a therapy or a hypothesis under discussion i m lostcandida can do that to you gordon i think that the best clinicaltrial for candida blooms would involve giving women with chronic vaginalcandida blooms l acidophilus orally and see it it can decrease thefrequency and extent of candida blooms in the vagina since most of thecandida seems to be migrating in from the anal region and l acidophilusshould be able keep the candida in check if it can make it through theintestinal tract and colonize in the anus where it will have access tooxygen just like it does in the vagina as much stuff as there is in thelay press about l acidophilus and vaginal yeast infections i m reallyamazed that someone has not done a clinical trial yet to check it outthe calcium and kidney stone story is not a good reason to throw allconventional wisdom out the window where would medicine be ifconventional wisdom had not been used to develop many of the standardmedical practices that could not be confirmed through clinical trialsthe clinical trial is a very new arrival on the medical scene and a veryimportant one the lack of proof that reinnoculation with good bacteriaafter antibiotic use is important to the health of a patient is no reasonto dismiss it out of hand especially if reinnoculation can be done cleaplyand safely like it is in animal husbandry marty b
