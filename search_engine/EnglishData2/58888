i have been contemplating this idea for some time as well i am not doctor but my wife is a nurse and i know a lot of doctors and nurses the point here being that doctors and nurses do not seem to get sic nearly as much as people outside the medical professionthis is a lovely area for anecdotes but i am sure you are on to somethingas a physician i almost never get sick usually when something horrendouis going around i either don t get it at all or get a very mild casewhen i do get really sick it is always something unusualthis was not the situation when i was in medical school particularly opediatrics i never had younger siblings myself and when i went on thpediatric wards i suddenly found myself confronting all sorts of infectiouchallenges that my body was not ready for pediatrics for me was three solimonths of illness and i had a temp of 104 when i took the final exami think what happens is that during training and beyond we are constantlexposed to new things and we have the usual reactions to them so that lateon when challenged with something it is more likely a re exposure for usso we deal with it well and get a mild illness i don t think it is thathe immune system is hyped up in any way also don t forget that thhospital flora is very different from the home and we carry a lot of thaaround k
