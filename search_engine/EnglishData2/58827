what is wrong with the above observation is that it explicitly gives thimpression and you may not in fact hold this view that the common perhapeven the correct approach for a scientist to follow is to sit arounhaving flights of fancy and scheming on the basis of his jealousies anpetty hatredsflights of fancy and other irrational approaches are common the cruciathing is not to sit around just having fantasies they arent of any usunless they make you do some experiments ive known a lot of scientistwhose fantasies lead them on to creative work usually they wont admiout loud what the fantasy was prior to the consumption of a few beerssimple example warren jelinek noticed an extremely heavy band on a dnelectrophoresis gel of human alu fragments he got very excited hoping thahed seen some essential part of the control mechanism for eukaryotigenes this fantasy led him to sequence samples of the band and carry oubinding assays the result was a wellconserved 400 or so bp sequencthat occurs about 500000 times in the human genome unfortunately fowarrens fantasy it turns out to be a transposon that is present iso many copies because it replicates itself and copies itself back intthe genome on the other hand the characteristics of transposons wermuch elucidated the necessity of a cellular reverse transcriptase warecognized and the standard method of recognizing human dna was createdother species have different sets of transposons fortunately for mewarren and i used to eat dinner at tgi fridays all the timeit further at least implicitly advances the position thasciences goes forward and it is not clear what this means given thcontext in which it occurs by generating in a completely nonrationaand even random way a plethora of hypotheses and theories that are theweeded out via the critical function of scienceim not sure that its random but there is no known rational mechanisfor generating a rich set of interesting hypotheses if you are reallworking in an unknown area it is unlikely that you will have much sensof what might or might not be true under those circumstances the besthing to do is just follow whatever instincts you have if they are wrongyou will find out soon enough but at least you will find out somethingif you try to do experiments at random with no prior conceptions at alin mind you will probably get nowherethough why this criticafunction should be less subject to the nonrational forces is a mysteryunfortunately the critical function does sometimes become hostage tnonrational forces then we get varieties of pathological sciencelysenko mirskys opposition to dnaasgene cold fusion and so forthif experimental design hypotheses creation and theory construction arsubject to jealousies and petty hatreds then this must be equally truof the application of any critical function concerning replicationthis is what leads one ala feyerabend to an anything goes viewi dont agree that this follows in fact this is exactly the point awhich i disagree with feyerabend it is a most important part of thculture of science that one keeps ones jealousies out of the refereeinprocess failures there are aplenty but on the whole things work outanother point there are a couple of senses of the phrase experimentadesign id say that the less rational part is in experimental choicenot design alexander fleming proc royal soc 1922 chose to look fobacteriophage in his own mucus for strange reasons phage had previouslbeen found in locust diarrhea fleming probably thought runny bottom runnnose what the hell its worth a try but his method of looking for phagwas welldesigned to detect anything phagelike in fact he found lysozymetrue the generation part can be totally irrational but typically it inot anecdotes concerning instances where a hypothesis seems to havresulted in some way from a dream or from ones political views simpldo not generalize well to the actual history of scienceit is not clear to me what you mean by rational vs irrational perhapyou can give a few examples of surprising experiments that were tried oufor perfectly rational reasons or interesting new theories that were firsadvanced from logical grounds the main examples i can think of are fromodern highenergy physics which is not typical of science as a wholemark a fulktttuniversity of rochestecomputer science departmenttfulkcsrochestered
