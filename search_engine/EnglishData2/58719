michael holloway writes lee lady writesi would also like to point out that most of the arguments about sciencin scimed scipsychology etc are not about cases where people arrejecting scientific argumentevidenceproof they are about cases wherno adequate scientific research has been done in some cases there iquite a bit of evidence but it isnt in a format to fit doctrinairconceptions of what science is here it is again this indicates confusion between proof and the procesof doing science you are making precisely one of the points i wanted to makei fully agree with you that there is a big distinction between thprocess of science and the end result as an end result of science one wants to get results that arobjectively verifiable but there is nothing objective about thprocess of science if good empirical research were done and showed that there is some merito homeopathic remedies this would certainly be valuable informationbut it would still not mean that homeopathy qualifies as a science thiis where you and i disagree with turpin in order to have science onmust have a theoretical structure that makes sense not a mercollection of empirically validated random hypothesesexperiment and empirical studies are an important part of science buthey are merely the culmination of scientific research the mosimportant part of true scientific methodology is scientific thinking without this one does not have any hypotheses worth testing nohypotheses do not just leap out at you after you look at enough datanor do they simply come to you in a flash one day while youre shaving olooking out the window at least not unless youve done a lot of reallgood thinking beforehand the difference between a nobel prize level scientist and a mediocrscientist does not lie in the quality of their empirical methodology it depends on the quality of their thinking it really bothers me that so many graduate students seem to believe thathey are doing science merely because they are conducting empiricastudies and it bothers me even more that there are many fields such acertain parts of psychology where there seems to be no thinking at allbut mere studies testing ad hoc hypotheses and im especially offended by russell turpins repeated assertion thascience amounts to nothing more than avoiding mistakes simply avoidinmistakes doesnt get you anywhere in the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists psychology seemsless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects ladyuhunixuhcchawaiiedu ladyuhunixbitne
