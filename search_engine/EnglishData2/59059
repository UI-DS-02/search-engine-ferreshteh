i have become involved in a project to further develop andimprove the performance of spect single photon emissiocomputerized tomography imaging we will eventually havto peddle this stuff somewhere and so as i move this thinalong i would like to know what is the current resolution of spect imaging what kindof jobs is spect used for specifically what kind of specific jobcould i hopthat spect could be used for if its resolution improvedsay to close to that of pet positron emission tomography and how much does a spect machine cost how much does a singlspect image cost if anyone knows the answer to any or all of these questions owhere i could find that answer i would be very grateful indeed thanks in advance for any replie t t t t tdave elieze t t t t teliezer physics llnl go
