what is wrong with the above observation is that it explicitly gives thimpression and you may not in fact hold this view that the common perhapeven the correct approach for a scientist to follow is to sit arounhaving flights of fancy and scheming on the basis of his jealousies anpetty hatredsflights of fancy and other irrational approaches are common the cruciathing is not to sit around just having fantasies they arent of any usunless they make you do some experiments ive known a lot of scientistwhose fantasies lead them on to creative work usually they wont admiout loud what the fantasy was prior to the consumption of a few beersthe danger in philosophizing about science is that theory and generalizationcan end up being far removed from the actual daytoday of the grunt at thbench yes its great to be involved in a process were i can walk into thlab after a heavy night of dreaming and just do something for the hell of ias long as my advisor doesnt catch me which is easy enough to do butstamping out such behavior seems to be the purpose in life of grant reviewcommittees and the peer review process in general in todays world thatswhat determines what science is what gets funded and a damn good thing toflights of fantasy just dont have much chance of producing anything atleast not in biomedical research the surest way for a graduate student truin their life is to work in a lab where the boss is more concerned withfleshing out hisher fantasies than with having the student work on a projecthat actually has a good chance of producing some results mds seem tobe particularly prone to this aberrant behavior simple example warren jelinek noticed an extremely heavy band on a dnelectrophoresis gel of human alu fragments he got very excited hoping thahed seen some essential part of the control mechanism for eukaryotigenes this fantasy led him to sequence samples of the band and carry oubinding assays the result was a wellconserved 400 or so bp sequencthat occurs about 500000 times in the human genome unfortunately fowarrens fantasy it turns out to be a transposon that is present iso many copies because it replicates itself and copies itself back intthe genome on the other hand the characteristics of transposons wermuch elucidated the necessity of a cellular reverse transcriptase warecognized and the standard method of recognizing human dna was createdother species have different sets of transposons fortunately for mewarren and i used to eat dinner at tgi fridays all the timei have to agree with gary merrills response to this ive read alot of thalu and middle repetitive sequence work and its really very interestinggood work with implications for many fields in molecular genetics itsreally an example of how a well reasoned project turned up interestingresults that were unexpectedmik
