in a previous article dougb comm mot com doug bank says organ donors are healthy people who have died suddenly usually through accident or head injury they are brain dead the organs are kept alive through mechanical means ok so how do you define healthy people my wife cannot donate blood because she has been to a malarial regio in the past three years in fact she tried to have her bone marro typed and they wouldn t even do that why i can t donate blood either because not only have i been to a malaria region but i have also been diagnosed and surgically treated fo testicular cancer the blood bank wont accept blood from me for 1 years obviously it wouldn t be of much help to treat one problem by knowinglyintroducing another cancer mestastizes my imperfect understanding ofthe facts are that gonadal cancer is particularly dangerous in this regard i haven t done the research on it but i don t recall ever hearing of acase of cancer being transmitted by a blood transfusion probably just acommon sense kind of arbitrary precaution transmissable diseases likemalaria though are obviously another story michael hollowae mail mhollowa ccmail sunysb edu mail to freenet is forwardedphone 516 444 309
