great post martin very informative well balanced and humanitariawithout neglecting the need for scientific rigor cross posted to alt psychology personality since some personality typinwill be discussed at the beginning note i ve set all followups to sci mesince most of my comments are more sci med oriented and i m sure most of threplies if any will be med related i can not believe the way this thread on candida yeast has progressed steve dyer and i have been exchanging words over the same topic in sci med nutrition when he displayed his typical reserve and attacked a woman poster for being treated by a licenced physician for a disease that did not exist calling this physician a quack was reprehensible steve and i see that you and some of the others are doing it here as well they are just responding in their natural way hyper choleric syndrome hcs oops that is not a recognized illness in the psychological communitybetter not say that since it therefore must not and never will exist actually it is fascinating that a disproportionate number of physicianwill type out as nt for those not familiar with the myers briggs systemjust e mail me and i ll send a summary file to you in the generapopulation nt s comprise only about 12 of the population but amonphysicians it is much much higher i don t know the exact percentage any help here a p p er s one driving characteristic of an nt especially an ntj is their obvioucholeric behavior driver type a etc the extreme emotional need tcontrol to lead and or to be the best or the most competent if they aralso extroverted they are best described as field marshalls this traiis very valuable and essential in our society we need people who want tlead to strive to overcome the elements to seek and thirst for knowledgeto raise the level of competency etc the great successes in science antechnology are in large part due to the vision an n trait and scientificallyminded approach t trait of the nt personality of course the other typeand temperaments have their own positive contributions as well howeverwhen the nt person has self image challenges the dark side of thipersonality type usually comes out which should be obvious to alla physician who is a strong nt and who has not learned to temper theitemperament will be extremely business like lack of empathy or feeling and is very compelled to have total control over their patient the patienmust be obedient to their diagnosis and prescription without question i vknown many m d s of this temperament and suffice to say i don t oblige thewith a followup visit no matter how competent i think they are and theusually are very competent from a knowledge viewpoint since that is aextreme drive of theirs to know the most to know it all maybe we need more nf doctor s enough on this subject let s move on to candida bloom let me tell you who the quacks really are these are the physicans who have no idea how the human body interacts with it s environment and how that balance can be altered by diet and antibiotics could it just b professional jealousy i couldn t help elaine or jon but somebody else didyou ve helped me already by your post of course i believe that i havbeen misdiagnosed on the net as suffering from anal retentivitis but beinthe phlegmatic i am maybe i was just a little too harsh on a few peoplmyself in past posts let s all try to raise the level of this discussioabove the level of anal effluent humans have all kinds of different organisms living in the gi system mouth stomach small and large intestine sinuses vagina and on the skin these are nonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immune system is compromised they are also called nonpathogens because unlike the pathogenic organisms that cause human disease they do not produce toxins as they live out their merry existence in and on our body but any of these organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up residence within the body a poor mucus membrane barrier can let this happen and vitamin a is mainly responsible for setting up this barrierin my well described situation in prior posts i definitely was immunstressed blood tests showed my vitamin a levels were very low my sinusewere a mess no doubt the mucosal lining and the cilia were heavily damagedi also was on antibiotics 15 times in 4 years in the end even two weekof ceftin did not work and i had confirmed diagnoses of a chronic bacteriainfection of the sinuses via cat scans mucus color won t get into thdetails and other symptoms three very traditional ent s made thidiagnosis i did not have any cultures done however because of thdifficulty of doing this right and because my other symptoms clearly showea bacterial infection enough of this background provided to help younderstand where i was when i make comments about my sporanox anti fungatherapy below the first question i have is this can fungus penetrate a little way into poomucus membrane tissue maybe via hyphae thus causing symptoms without beinconsidered systemic in the classic sense it is sort of an inbetweeinfection steve got real upset with elaine s doctor because he was using anti fungals and vitamin a for her gi problems if steve really understoood what vitamin a does in the body he would not or at least should not be calling elaine s doctor a quacki was concerned too because of the toxicity of vitamin a my doctor aftemy blood tests put me on 75 000 iu of vitamin a for one week only thedropped it down to 25 000 iu for the next couple of weeks i also receivezinc and other supplementation since all of these interrelate in fairlcomplex ways as my doctor explained he s one of those evil orthomoleculaspecialists i had a blood test three weeks later and vitamin a was normalhe then stopped me on all vitamin a except for some in a multi vitaminsupplement and made sure that i maintain a 50 000 iu day of beta carotenecall me carrot face hopefully elaine s doctor will take a similar careful approach and tall supplements i m even reevaluating some supplements i m taking foexample niacin in fairly large dosages 1 gram day which steve dyer hagood information about on sci med nutrition if niacin only has second ordeimprovement in symptomatic relief of my sinus allergies then it probably inot worth taking such a large dose long term and risking liver damage survives if it gets access to a lot of glucose it blooms and over rides the other organisms living with it in the sinuses gi tract or vagina inthough i do now believe based on my successful therapy with sporanox thai definitely had some excessive growth of fungus unknown species in msinuses i still want to ask the question have there been any studies thademonstrate candida blooms in the sinuses with associated sinus irritatio sinusitis rhinitis my sinus irritation reduced significantly after onweek of sporanox and no other new treatments were implemented during thitime i did not have any noticeable gi track problems before starting osporanox but some for a few days after which then went away considerenormal btw my doctor dug out one of his medical reference books sorry can remember which one and found an obscure comment dating back into the 1950 which stated that people can develop contained non lethal or non seriousaspergillis infestations aspergiliosis of the sinuses leading to sinuinflammation symptoms i ll have to dig out that reference again since iis relevant to this discussion some people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus membrane or skin bloom site whether this is an allergic like reaction to the candida or not isn t certainmy doctor tested me i believe a rast or rast similar test for allergiresponse to specificially candida albicans and i showed a strong positiveanother question would everybody show the same strong positive so this tesis essentially useless and assuming it is true that candida can gropart way into the mucus membrane tissue and the concentration exceeds athreshold amount could not a person who tests as having an allergy tcandida definitely develop allergic symptoms such as mucus membranirritation due to the body s allergic response as i said in an earlier postone does not need to be a rocket scientist or have a m d degree or aph d in biochemistry to see the plausibility of this hypothesisbtw and i ll repost this again dr ivker in his book sinus survival has routinely given before anything else nizoral a pre sporanox systemianti fungal not as safe and not as good as sporanox to his new chronisinusitis patients if they have been on antibiotics four or more times ithe last two years he claims that out of 2000 or so patients well ove90 notice some relief of sinus inflammation and other symptoms but idoesn t cure it by any means implying the so called yeast fungus infectiois not the primary cause but a later complication he s also found thanystatin whether taken internally or put into a sinus spray does not helpthis implies of course assuming that excessive yeast fungus bloom iaggravating the sinus inflammation that the yeast fungus has grown partwainto the tissue since nystatin will not kill yeast fungus other than bdirect contact it is not absorbed into the blood stream again i admitlots of ifs and implies which doesn t please the hard core nt whhas to have the double blind study or it s a non issue but one has to starwith some plausible hypothesis explanation a strawman if you will if it s internal only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty nondescript this brings up an interesting observation used by those who will denand reject any and all aspects of the yeast hypothesis until thappropriate studies are done and that is if you can t observe or culturthe yeast bloom in the gut or sinus then there s no way to diagnose oeven recognize the disease and i know they realize that it is virtuallimpossible to test for candida overbloom in any part of the body that cannobe easily observed since candida is everywhere in the bodyit s a real catch 22another catch 22 those who totally reject the yeast hypothesis say thano studies have been done actually studies have been done but if it s noup to a certain standard then it is from their perspective a non study whicshould not even be considered i agree that the appropriate studies shoulbe done and that will take big to do it right however in order tconvince the funding agencies in these austere times to open their walletsyou literally have to give them evidence and the only acceptable evidence tcompete with other proposals is paradoxically to do almost the exact studneeded funding that is you have to do 90 of the study before you even gefunding as a scientist at a national lab i m very aware of this for thsmaller funded projects i m afraid that even if dr ivker and 100 othedoctors got together pooled their practice s case histories and anecdoteinto a compelling picture and approach the funding agencies they would genowhere even if they were able to publish their statistical resultsit is obvious from the comments by some of the doctors here is that they hav decided excessive yeast colonization in the gut or sinuses leading tnoticeable non lethal symptoms does not exist and is not even a tenablhypothesis so any amount of case histories or compiled anecdotal evidencto the contrary will never change their mind and not only that they woulalso oppose the needed studies because in their minds it s a done issue excessive yeast growth leading to diffuse allergic symptoms does not wilnot and cannot exist period kind of tough to dialog with those who holsuch a viewpoint kind of reminds me of lister candida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in the sinuses the gi tract mouth stomach and intestines and in the vaginal tract which compete with it for food the human immune system ususally does not bother itself with these nonpathogenic organisms unless they broach the mucus membrane barrier if they do an inflammatory response will be set up most americans are not getting enough vitamin a from their diets about 30 of all american s die with less vitamin a than they were born with u s autopsy studies while this low level of vitamin a does not cause pathology blindness it does impair the mucus membrane barrier system this would then be a predisposing factor for a strong inflammatory response after a candida bloom aren t there also other nutrients necessary to the proper working of thsinus mucus membranes and cilia while diabetics can suffer from a candida bloom the most common cause of this type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which knock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main competition for candida as far as food is concerned while drugs are available to handle candida many patients find that their doctor will not use them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection the toxicity of the anti fungal drugs does warrant some caution but if the gi or sinus inflammation is suspected to be candida and recent use of a broad spectrum antibiotic is the smoking gun then anti fungal use should be approrpriate just as the anti fungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring vaginal yeast infections in spite of what mr steve dyer saysagain the evidence from mycological studies indicate that many yeast funguspecies can grow hyphae roots into deep tissue similar to mold growinin bread you can continue to kill the surface such as nystatin does buyou can t kill that which is deeper in the tissue without using a systemianti fungal such as itraconazole sporanox or some of the older ones sucas nizoral which are more toxic and not as effective this is why as habeen pointed out by recent studies sent to me by a doctor i ve been ie mail contact with thanks that nystatin is not effective in the longterm treatment of gi tract candidiasis it s like trying to weed a gardeby cutting off what s above the ground but leaving the roots ready to comout again once you walk awaythe 60000 question is whether a contained candida bloom can partiallgrow into tissue through the mucus membranes causing some types of symptomin susceptible people e g allergy without becoming systemic in thclassical sense of the word something in between strictly an excessivbloom not causing any problems and the full blown systemic infection thais potentially lethal in the gi system the ano rectal region seems to be a particularly good reservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very favorable environment around the rectum for transfer through moisture and humidity of candida to the vaginal tract one of the most effctive ways to minimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear also if one is an anal retentive like i ve been diagnosed in a priopost that can also provide more sites for excessive candida growth if the bloom occurs in the anal area the burning swelling pain and even blood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids if the bloom manages to move further up the gi tract very diffuse symptomatology occurs abdominal discomfort and blood in the stool this positive stool for occult blood is what sent elaine to her family doctor in the first place after extensive testing he told her that there was nothing wrong but her gut still hurt on to another doctor and so on richard kaplan has told me throiugh e mail that he considers occult blood tests in stool specimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of false positives candida blooms guys if my gut hurt me on a constant basis i would want it fixed yes it s nice to know that i don t have colon cancer but what then is causing my distress when i finally find a doctor who treats me and gets me 90 better steve dyer calls him a quackas i ve said in private e mail there are flaws in our current medical systethat make it difficult or even impossible for a physician to attempalternative therapies after the approved proven accepted therapies don t workfor example i went to three ent s who all said that i will just have to livwith my acute chronic sinusitis after the ab s failed they did mentiosurgery to open up the ostia but my ostia weren t plugged and it would noget to the root cause of my condition after three months of aggressive anfairly non standard therapy sporanox body nutrient level monitoring anequalization vitamin c lentinen echinacea etc my health has vastlimproved to where i was two years ago before my health greatly deterioratedof course skeptics would say that maybe if i did nothing i would havimproved anyway but that view is stretching things quite far because of thexperience of the three ent s i saw who said that i d just have to live witit i m confident i will reach what one could call a total cure thanti fungal program i undertook was one necessary step in that directiobecause of my overuse of ab s for the last four years note for thoshaving sinus problems may i suggest the book by dr ivker i mention abovebe sure to get the revised edition i have often wondered what an m d with chronic gi distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his patients is a non existent syndromedr ivker started off having chronic and severe sinus problems and hivisits to several ent s totally floored him when they said you ll just havto live with it he spent several years trying everything standard annon standard until he was essentially cured of chronic sinusitis he noshares his approach in his book and i can honestly say that i am on the roato recovery following some parts of it his one recommendation to take systemic anti fungal at the beginning of treatment if you have a history oanti biotic overuse has been proven to him time and time again in his owpractice i m sure if i commented to him of the hard core beliefs of the anti yeast hypothesis posters that he would have definite things to say such as it s worked wonders for me in almost two thousand cases to put it mildlyi also would not be surprised if he would say that they are the ones violatintheir moral obligations to help the patientmaybe those doctors who are reading this who have a practice and arconfronted by a patient having symptoms that could be due to the hypotheticayeast overgrowth e g they fit some of the profiles the pro yeast peoplhave identified should consider anti fungal therapy if all other avenuehave been exhausted remember theory and practice are two different things you cannot have one without the other they are synergistic if a doctor doesomething non standard yet produces noticeable symptomatic relief in over thousand of his patients shouldn t you at least sit up and take noticemaybe you ought to trust what he says and begin hypothesizing why it workinstead of why it shouldn t work i m afraid a lot of doctors have becomso enamored with scientific correctness that they are ignoring the patientthey have sworn to help you have to do both both have to be balanced whicwe don t see from some of the posters to this group there comes a point wheyou just have to use a little common sense and maybe an empirical approac such as trying a good systemic anti fungal such as sporanox after havinexhausted all the other avenues i was one of those who the traditionamedical establishment was not able to help so i did the natural thing went to a couple of doctor s who are somewhat outside this establishmentand as a result i have found significant reliefwould it not be better if the traditional medical establishment can set usome kind of mechanism where any doctor without fear of being sued or havinhis license pulled can try experimental and unproven beyond a doubttherapies for his her patients that finally reach the point where all thaccepted therapies are ineffective i d like to hear a doctor tell me well i ve tried all the therapies that are approved and accepted in thicountry and since they clearly don t work for you i now have the authoritto use experimental unproven techniques that seem to have helped others can t promise anything and there are some risks you will have to sigsomething saying you understand the experimental and possibly risky nature othese unproven therapies and i ll have to register your case at the statboard anyway if my ent had suggested this to me i would ve jumped on thipronto instead of going to one of those doctors who for either altruistireasons or for greed is practicing these alternative therapies with mucrisk to him her risk meaning losing their license and possibly to thpatient such a mechanism would keep control in the more mainstream medicineand also provide valuable data that would essentially be free it also woulbe morally and ethically better than the current system by showing thcompassion of the medical community to the patient that it s doing everythinit can within reason to help the patient it is the lack of such a mechanisthat is leading large numbers of people to try alternative therapies some owhich seem to work like my case and others of which will never work at al true quackery i better get off my soapbox before this post reaches 500k in size if taken orally it can also become a major bacteria in the gut through aresol sprays it has also been used to innoculate the sinus membranes but before this innoculation occurs the mucus membrane barrier system needs to be strengthened this is accomplished by vitamin a vitamin c and some of the b complex vitamins diet surveys repeatedly show that americans are not getting enough b6 and folate these are probably the segement of the population that will have the greatest problem with this non existent disorder candida blooms after antibiotic therapy what dosage of b6 appears to be necessary to promote the healing and propeworking of the mucos memebranes some of the above material was obtained from natural healing by mark bricklin published by rodale press as well as notes from my human nutrition course i will be posting a discussion of vitamin a sometime in the future along with reference citings to point out the extremely important role that vitamin a plays in the mucus membrane defense system in the body and why vitamin a should be effective in dealing with candida blooms another effective dietary treatment is to restrict carbohydrate intake during the treatment phase this is especially important if the gi system is involved if candida can not get glucose it s not going to out grow the bacteria and you then give bacteria which can use amino acids and fatty acids for energy a chance to take over and keep the candida in check once carbohydrate is returned to the guti d like to see the role of complex carbohydrates such as starch if steve and some of the other nay sayers want to jump all over this post fine i jumped all over steve in sci med nutrition because he verbably accosted a poster who was seeking advice about her doctor s use of vitamin a and anti fungals for a candida bloom in her gut people seeking advice from newsnet should not be treated this way those of us giving of our time and knowledge can slug it out to our heart s content if you saved your venom for me steve and left the helpless posters who are timidly seeking help alone i wouldn t have a problem with your behavior brave soul you are the venom on usenet can be quite toxic unless ondevelops an immunity to it one year ago my phlegmatic self would havbacked down right away from an attack of cholericitis but my immunsystem and my computer system have been hardened from graduadesensitization i now kind of like being called anal
