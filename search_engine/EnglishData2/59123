that all countries share in combating aids it shouldbe noted that while aids leads in hastening global health interdependence itis not the only illness doing so diseases such as malaria and many respiratory and intestinal pathogens have similarly inhibited the economicdevelopment of most of humanity and acted to marginalize large populations berkley mentions the enormous social and economic impact that aids will haveon many developing countries and the increased need for internationalassistance that will result berkley also cites the lack of politicalaggressiveness toward the aids epidemic in its first decade but now thereis a new administration with a promise of substantial differences in approachto international health and development in general and hiv aids inparticular vice president al gore proposes in his book earth in thebalance a major environmental initiative that includes sustainableinternational development with programs to promote literacy improve childsurvival

in new york n y in reply to a letter by drs gellert andnordenberg although it is true that diseases other than aids such asmalaria and respiratory and intestinal illnesses have similarly inhibited economic development in developing countries and deserve much more attentionthan they are getting berkley disagrees with the contention that aids isreceiving too much attention hiv differs from other diseases in mostdeveloping countries because it is continuing to spread for most endemicdiseases the outcome of neglecting interventions for one year is anotheryear of about the same level of needless disease and death but with aidsand its increasing spread the cost of neglect not only in disease burdenbut financially is much greater interventions in the early part of arampantly spreading epidemic like hiv are highly cost effective because eachindividual infection prevented significantly interrupts transmission berkleysays he agrees with gellert and nordenberg about the gigantic social and

immunodeficiency virus can cause diseaseindependently of its ability to suppress the immune system say scientists atthe national institues of health they report that hiv itself not an opportunistic infection caused scalingskin conditions to develop in mice carrying the genes for hiv although thehiv genes were active in the mice they did not compromise the animals immunity the researchers found this led them to conclude that the hivitself caused the skin disease our findings support a growing body of evidence that hiv can cause diseasewithout affecting the immune system said lead author dr jeffrey kopp of thenational institute of dental research nidr dr kopp and his colleaguesdescribed their study in the march issue of aids research and humanretroviruses developing animal models of hiv infection has been difficult since mostanimals including mice cannot be infected by the virus to bypass thisproblem scientists have developed hiv transgenic mice which carry genes forhiv as well as their own genetic material nidr scientists created the transgenic mice by injecting hiv genes into mouseeggs and then implanting the eggs into female mice the resulting litterscontained both normal and transgenic animals institute scientists had created mice that carried a complete copy of hivgenetic material in l988 those mice however became sick and died too soonafter birth to study in depth in the present study the scientists used anincomplete copy of hiv which allowed the animals to live longer some of the transgenic animals developed scaling wart like tumors on theirnecks and backs other transgenic mice developed thickened crusting skinlesions that covered most of their bodies resembling psoriasis in humans noskin lesions developed in their normal non transgenic littermates studies of tissue taken from the wart like skin tumors showed that they were atype of noncancerous tumor called papilloma although the papillomavirus cancause these skin lesions laboratory tests showed no sign of that virus in theanimals tissue samples taken from the sick mice throughout the study revealed thepresence of a protein producing molecule made by the hiv genetic material hicnet medical newsletter page 5volume 6 number 10 april 20 199evidence of hiv protein production proved that the viral genes were turnedon or active said dr kopp the scientists found no evidence however of compromised immunity in themice no increase in their white blood cell count and no signs of commoninfections the fact that hiv genes were active but the animals immunesystems were not suppressed confirms that the virus itself was causing theskin lesions dr kopp said further proof of hiv gene involvement came from a test in which the scientistsexposed the transgenic animals to ultraviolet light the light increased hivgenetic activity causing papillomas to develop on formerly healthy skin papilloma formation in response to increased hiv genetic activity proved thegenes were responsible
