msnydernmtedu rebecca snyder writesdoes anyone know how posionous centipedes and millipedes are if someonwas bitten how soon would medical treatment be needed and what woulbe liable to happen to the personjust for clarification i have not been bitten by one of these but mhouse seems to be infested and i want to know just in caserebecc tmillipedes i understand are vegetarian and therefore almos certainly will not bite and are not poisonous centipedes ar carnivorous and although i dont have any absolute knowledge on this would tend to think that youre in no danger from anything but concerted assault by several million of them tttgnot sure of this but i think some millipedes cause a toxic reaction stingso i would not assume that they are not dangerous merely on the basis ofvegetarianism after all wasps are vegetarian toodnc
