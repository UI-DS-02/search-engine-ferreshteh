there is no convincing evidence that such a disease existstheres a lot of evidence it just hasnt been adequately gathered anpublished in a way that will convince the diehard melancholic skepticwho quiver everytime the word anecdote or empirical is usedsnort ah there go my sinuses againfor example dr ivker who wrote the book sinus survival always givesoh wow a classic textbook hey they laughed at einstein toobefore any other treatment a systemic antifungal such as nizoral to hinew patients if theyve been on braodspectrum antibiotics 4 or more timein the last two years hes kept a record of the results and for over2000 patients found that over 90 of his patients get significant relieof allergicsinus symptoms of course this is only the beginning for hiprogramyeah ill bet tomorrow the worldlisten uncontrolled studies like this are worthlessin my case as i reported a few weeks ago i was developing the classisymptoms outlined in the yeast connection i agree it is a poorlywritten book eg extreme sensitivity to plastics vapors etc whici never had before started in november within one week of full dosagof sporanox the sensitivity to chemicals has fully disappeared i canow sit on my couch at home without dying after two minutes im alsgreatly improved in other areas as wellim sure you are you sound like the typical hysterichypochondriac whresponds to miracle curesof course i have allergy symptoms etc i am especially allergic tmolds yeasts etc it doesnt take a rocket scientist to figure out thaif one has excessive colonization of yeast in the body and you have natural allergy to yeasts that a threshold would be reached where yowould have perceptible symptomsyeah it makes sense to me so of course it should be taken seriouslysnortalso yeast do produce toxins of variousorts and again you dont have to be a rocket scientist to realize thasuch toxins can cause problems in some peopleyeah it sounds reasonable to meof course the 6000question is whether a person who is immune compromised as tests showed i wafrom over 5 years of antibiotics nutritionallydeficiencies because of thstress of infections and allergies etcoh really what tests immunecompromised my assmore like credulous malingerer this is a psychiatric syndromecan develop excessive yeascolonization somewhere in the body it is a tough question to answer sinctesting for excessive yeast colonization is not easy one almost has ttake an empirical approach to diagnosis fortunately sporanox is relativelsafe unlike past antifungals still have to be careful however so thereno reason any longer to withhold sporanox treatment for empirical reasonsyou know its a shame that a drug like itraconazole is being misusein this way its ridiculously expensive and potentially toxicthe trouble is that it isnt toxic enough so it gets abused by quacksbtw some would say to try nystatin unfortunately most yeast grows hyphatoo deep into tissue for nystatin to have any permanent affect youll fina lot of people who are on nystatin all the timethe only good thing about nystatin is that its relatively cheaand when taken orally nontoxic but oral nystatin is without ansystemic effect so unless it were given iv it would be withouany effect on your sinuses i wish these quacks would first usiv nystatin or amphotericin b on people like you that would solvthe yeast problem once and for allin summary i appreciate all of the attempts by those who desire to keemedicine on the right road but methinks that some who hold too firmlto the party line are academics who havent been in the trenches long enougactually treating patients if anybody doctors included said to me to mface that there is no evidence of the yeast connection i cannot guarantetheir safety for their incompetence ripping off their lips is justified afar as i am concernedperhaps a little haldol would go a long way towards amelioratinyour symptomsare you paying for this treatment out of your own pocket id hatto think my insurance premiums are going towards thissteve dyedyerursamajorspdcccom aka imaharvardrayssdlinusm2cspdccdye
