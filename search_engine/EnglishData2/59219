if you cant observe or culture the yeast bloom in th gut or sinus then theres no way to diagnose or even recogniz the disease and i know they realize that it is virtuall impossible to test for candida overbloom in any part of the body that cannot be easily observed since candida is everywhere in the body youve just discovered one of the requirements for a good quack theory find something that no one can disprove and then write a book sayin it is the cause of whatever since no one can disprove it you ca rake in the bucks for quite some time i hope gordon banks did not mean to imply that notions such ahardtosee candida infections causing various problems should nobe investigated many researchers have made breakthroughs byfiguring out how to investigate things that were previously thoughvirtually impossible to test forindeed i would be surprised if candida overbloom were such phenomena i would think that candida would produce signaturbyproducts whose measure would then set a lower bound on theextent of recent infection i realize this might get quitetricky and difficult probably expensive and likely inconvenienor uncomfortable to the subjects but that is not the same asvirtually impossiblerussel
