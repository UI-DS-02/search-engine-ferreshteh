than disadvantages write franklin volvovitz and gale smith ofmicrogenesys in meriden conn moore et al says that gp160 in a baculovirusexpression system does not bind strongly to the cd4 receptor and that this recombinant gp160 does not stimulate the same antibodies as the hiv 1 virusdoes in natural infection but vaccination with recombinant gp160 inpatients infected with hiv 1 broadens hiv 1

patientswith newly detected hiv infection were interviewed and dna sequence analysiswas performed to compare genetic relatedness of their hiv to that of thedentist death certificates were obtained for deceased patients and themedical records of those with diagnoses suggestive of hiv disease or drugabuse and those dying under the age of 50 years were examined in detail there were 1 192 patients who had undergone 9 267 procedures of whom 124 were deceased an examination of the death certificates of patientsidentified five who had died with hiv infection all of whom were eitherhomosexuals or iv drug users the researchers were able to detect 962 of theremaining 1 048 patients and 900 agreed to be tested hiv infection wasreported in five of the 900 patients including four who had clear evidenceof risk factors for the disease one patient who had only a single evaluation by the dentist denied high risk behavior comparative dna sequenceanalysis showed that the viruses from the dentists

resulted from work on thishypothesis schechter et al conclude that hiv has a key role in cd4 depletion and aids based on epidemiological correlations with antibodiesagainst hiv and with self reported
