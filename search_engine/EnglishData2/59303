as for how foods taste if i m not allergic to msg and i lik the taste of it why shouldn t i use it saying i shouldn t us it is like saying i shouldn t eat spicy food because my neighbo has an ulcer julie it doesn t necessarily follow that you should use it msg o something else for that matter simply because you are not allergi to it for example you might not be allergic to animal fats an like their taste yet it doesn t follow that you should be using the regularly msg might have other bad or good i am not up on knowledge of msg effects on your body in the long run maybe that reason enough not to use it perhaps i should quit eating mushrooms soya beans and brie cheeswhich all have msg in them it occurs naturallyi m not going to quit eating something that i like just becausit might cause me trouble later or causes problems in somepeople i would much rather avoid stress by not worrying ovewhat goes in my mouth and not spending every day reading conflictinreports of what is good bad for youi may eat some things in quantities that may not be good for mefine i ve made my decision and i don t think it s appropriatfor anyone to try to convert me it s for your own good arthe most obnoxious and harmful words imo in the english oany other language altho your example of the ulcer is funny it isn t a appropriate comparison at alli think it is i get tired of people saying don t eat x becausit s bad well x may not be bad for everyone and even iit is so what give people all the information but don t rayour decisions down their throatsjulidisclaimer all opinions here belong to my cat and no one els
