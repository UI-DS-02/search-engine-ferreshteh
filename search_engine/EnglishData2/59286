vonreyn c fordham the risk of hiv transmission from an hiv positive surgeon to patient isextremely low provided that the surgeon strictly adheres to universalinfection control procedures write c fordham von reyn et al of thedartmouth hitchcock medical center in lebanon n h the researchers contacted2 317 former patients on whom an hiv positive orthopedic surgeon performedinvasive procedures between january 1 1978 and june 30 1992 the orthopedic surgeon voluntarily withdrew from practice after testing positivefor hiv a total of 1 174 former patients underwent hiv testing representing 50 7 percent of patients on whom the orthopedic surgeonperformed invasive procedures during the 13 5 year period patients weretested from each year and from each category of invasive procedure allpatients were found to be negative for hiv by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay two former patients reported known hiv infection prior to surgery the examination of aids case registries and vital records neglected to detectcases of hiv infection among former surgical patients the estimated cost ofthe initial patient notification and testing was 158 000 with the singlemost expensive activity being counseling and testing this accounted for 37percent of the total expense the patient notification and testing wereconducted while maintaining the confidentiality of the orthopedic surgeon whowas an active participant in the planning and execution of the study notifying patients of the infected surgeon s hiv status is both disruptiveand expensive and is not routinely recommended the researchers

similarinvestigations writes audrey smith rogers et al of the johns hopkinsuniversity school of medicine in baltimore md the researchers identified atotal of 1 131 persons in hospital databases who underwent invasive surgical procedures between 1984 and 1990 and for whom the hiv positive surgeon waslisted as the operating surgeon the aids case registries were reviewed forall patients having undergone invasive procedures and death certificates wereobtained among the 1 131 patients 101 were dead 119 had no address 413had test results known and 498 did not respond to the questionnaire nostudy patient name was found in reported aids case registries one newlydetected hiv positive patient was determined to have been most probablyinfected in 1985 during a transfusion there was no hiv transmission in 369person hours of surgical exposure suggesting that hiv transmission topatients is unlikely to occur more frequently than once per 1000 person hoursof surgical exposure the researchers determined there is no evidence to suggest that the surgeon failed to adhere to standard infection controlguidelines over 50 percent of the patients with invasive procedures chose tobe tested and of those whose results were revealed only one person wasfound to be infected with hiv the study patient s infection was probablythe result of a tainted blood transfusion received in 1985 as a result there is no evidence that the transmission of hiv from the hiv positivesurgeon to any patient transpired the researchers conclude april 20 1993 drug concerns to share aids data new york times 04 20 93 p c10 kolata gina a total of 15 major pharmaceutical companies have decided in a highlyunusual move to share aids drugs and information while the drugs areundergoing early clinical testing dr edward scolnick president of themerck research laboratory in rahway n j arranged the collaboration hesaid that cooperation between companies seemed increasingly significant as ithad become clear that combinations of drugs were likely to be more effectivein fighting hiv than any drug used alone the researchers are hopeful thathiv when faced with a combination of several drugs requiring mutation atdifferent sites for resistance to develop will be unable to evolve all themutations at the same time therefore several drugs taken together or oneafter the other could halt the spread of hiv currently the drug companiesdo not know what other drugs their competitors are developing the newagreement allows companies to routinely exchange animal data and safety dataon new aids drugs an agreement like this will greatly facilitatehicnet medical newsletter page 3volume 6 number 11 april 25 199companies ability to choose the best drug combinations much faster and in amuch more efficient way said scolnick he also said that the collaboration would not violate antitrust laws in creating the agreement merck spoke frequently to members of aids advocacy groups including act up dr daniel

should not beadministered in people with full blown aids writes columnist john maddox azt has been used in the united states in asymptomatic hiv positive people onthe basis that administration of the drug appeared to abate the decline of t cell counts however a report in the lancet demonstrated that azt shouldnot be used early in the course of disease while the cd4 counts of the 877people given azt were consistently greater than those of patients receivingonly placebo the first three years of follow up have shown that theproportions of people in the two groups progressing to overt aids or even todeath were not significantly different at roughly 18 percent the conclusions are that azt is not an effective aids drug in hiv infectedindividuals and that cd4 cell count may not be a reliable proxy for theprogression to aids in infected people but nothing is implied by the studyof the utility of azt in the treatment of those in whom symptoms have alreadyappeared there is no case for abandoning that treatment at least on the evidence now available it is much more alarming that the cd4 count hasproven to be an unreliable mark of the efficacy of drug treatment in hivinfection aids
