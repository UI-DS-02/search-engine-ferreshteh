i agree with everything that lee lady wrote in her previous post ithis thread gee maybe ive misjudged you russell anyone who agrees with somethingi say cant be all bad seriously im not sure whether i misjudged you or not in one respect i still have a major problem though with your insistence that scienceis mainly about avoiding mistakes and i still disagree with yourcontention that nobody who doesnt use methods deemed scientificcan possibly know whats true and whats not deleted material which i agree with back to lee lady these are not the rules according to many who post to scimed an scipsychology according to these posters if its not supported b carefully designed controlled studies then its not sciencethese posters are making the mistake that i have previouslcriticized of adhering to a methodological recipe a carefully rules such as support the hypothesis by a carefully designed ancontrolled study are too narrow to apply to all investigationi think that the requirements for particular reasoning to bconvincing depends greatly on the kinds of mistakes that havoccurred in past reasoning about the same kinds of things treuse the previous example we know that conclusions frouncontrolled observations of the treatment of chronic medicaproblems are notoriously problematic okay so lets see if we agree on this first of all there are degreesof certainty it might be appropriate for instance to demand carefullycontrolled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth to theextent that there is any such thing the effectiveness of a certaintreatment on the other hand highly favorable clinical experience evenif uncontrolled can be adequate to justify a preliminary judgement thaa treatment is useful this is often the best evidence we can hope fofrom investigators who do not have institutional or corporate supportin this case it makes sense to tentatively treat claims as crediblbut to reserve final judgement until establishment scientists who arqualified and have the necessary resources can do more careful testingsecondly it makes sense to be more tolerant in our standards ofevidence for a pronounced effect than for one that is marginal i come to this dispute about what science is not only as mathematician but as a veteran of many arguments in scipsychology anoccasionally in scimed about nlp neurolinguistic programming mucof the work done to date by nlpers can be better categorized ainformal exploration than as careful scientific research for yearnow i have been trying to get scientific and clinical psychologists tjust take a look at it to read a few of the books and watch some othe videotapes courtesy of your local university library not fothe purpose of making a definitive judgement but simply to look at thnlp methodology especially the approach to eliciting information frosubjects and look for ideas and hypotheses which might be oscientific interest and most especially to be aware of thquestions nlp suggests which might be worthy of scientifiinvestigationover and over again the response i get in scipychology is if thihasnt been thoroughly validated by the accepted form of empiricaresearch then it cant be of any interest to us to me the ultimate reducio ad absurdum of the extreme thereve got tbe controlled studies position is an nlp technique called the fasphobiatrauma curesimple phobias as opposed to agoraphobia may not be the worlds mostimportant psychological disorder but the nice thing about them is thatit doesnt take a sophisticated instrument to diagnose them or tellwhen someone is cured of one the nlp phobia cure is a simplevisualization which requires less than 15 minutes nlpers claim thait can also be used to neutralize a traumatic memory and hence iuseful in treating posttraumatic stress syndrome it is essentialla variation on the classic desensitization process used by behavioratherapists a subject only needs to be taken through the technique oncor in the case of ptsd once for each traumatic incident thprocess doesnt need to be repeated and the subject doesnt need tpractice it over again at homenow to me it seems pretty easy to test the effectiveness of this cureespecially if as nlpers claim the success rate is extremely high take someone with a fear of heights as i used to have take them upto a balcony on the 20th floor and observe their response spend 15minutes to have them do the simple visualization send them back up tothe balcony and see if things have changed check back with them in afew weeks to see if the cure seems to be lasting more long termfollowup is certainly desirable but from a scientific point of vieweven a cure that lasts several weeks has significance in any casethere are many known cases where the cure has lasted years to the bestof my knowledge there is no known case where the cure has been reversedafter holding for a few weeks my own cure incidentally was donwith a slightly different nlp technique before i learned of the fastphobiatrauma cure ten years later now i enjoy living on the 17tfloor of my building and having a large balcony the folks over in scipsychology have a hundred and one excuses not tmake this simple test they claim that only an elaborate outcome studwill be satisfactory a study of the sort that nlp practitionersmany of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice can illafford to do most of them are also just plain not interested becausethe whole idea seems frivolous and since theyre not part of thscientific establishment they have no tangible rewards to gainfrom scientific acceptancethe fast phobiatrauma cure is over ten years old now and the clinicalpsychology establishment is still saying we dont have any way ofknowing that its effective these academics themselves have the resources to do a study as elaborateas anyone could want of course but they say why should i prove yourtheory and the burden of proof is on the one making the claim one academic in scipsychology said that it would be completelyunscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasntbeen described in a scientific journal its described in a number ofbooks and ive posted articles in scipsychology describing it in as muchdetail as im capable of actually at least one fairly careful academic study has been done withfavorable results but its apparently not acceptable because its doctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journalto me this sort of attitude does not advance science but hinders it this is the kind of thing i have in mind when i talk about doctrinnaireattitudes about science now maybe i have been unfair in imputing such attitudes to you russell if so i apologizein the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists psychology seemsless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects ladyuhunixuhcchawaiiedu ladyuhunixbitne
