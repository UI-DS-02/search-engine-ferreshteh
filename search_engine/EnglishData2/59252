kenisiscnscaltechedu writes i dont know the first thing about yeast infections but i am a scientist no scientist would take your statement no convincing empirical evidenc to support the existence of systemic yeast syndrome to tell yo anything except an absence of data on the questionthe burden of proof rests upon those who claim the existencof this syndrome to date these claims are unsubstantiateby any available data hopefully as a scientist you woultake issue with anyone overstating their conclusions baseupon their data beasties with present methods even if they were there noring and th fellow from oklahoma sorry forgot your name have also suggested one se of anecdotal evidence in favor based on their personal experiences namely that when people with certain conditions are given antifungals many of them appear to get better gee i have many interesting and enlightening anecdotes aboumyself my friends and my family but in the practice omedicine i expect and demand more rigorous rationales fobasing therapy than aunt susies brotherinlaw anecdotal evidence may provide inspiration for a hypothesisbut rarely proves anything in a positive sense and unlikmathematics boolean logic rarely applies directly to medicaissues and so evidence of exceptions does not usualldisprove but rather modifies current concepts of disease so if you have any evidence against the hypothesis for example controlled doubleblind studies showing that the antifungals dont do an better than sugar water then lets hear it if you dont then what w have is anecdotal and uncontrolled evidence on one side and abjec disbelief on the other in which case please there is no point in yellin back and forth at each other any longer since neither side has an convincing evidence either positive or negative i would characterize it not as abject disbelief but ratherscientific outrage over vastly overstated conclusions it appears to me the main question now is whether the proponents ca marshall enough anecdotal evidence in a convincing and documented enoug manner to make a good case for carrying out a good controlled doubleblin study of antifungals or else forget convincing anybody else to carry ou the test just carry it out themselves and also whether they ca adequately define the patient population or symptoms on which such a stud should be carried out to provide a fair test of the hypothesisi have no problem with such an approach but this is not whais happening in the trenches of this diagnosisbob schmie
