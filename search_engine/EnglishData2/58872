mhollowa ic sunysb edu michael holloway writes here s your error i really do think this shows some confusion on you part drum roll please science isn t so much the gathering of evidenc to support an assertion read hypothesis as it is the gathering o empirical observations in order to make an hypothesis what shoul convince you or not shouldn t be the final product so much as how th product was made here s your error there is no observation or hypothesis that is not tainte by theory i have a theory i make observations those observations will b made with my theory in mind yes absolutely though i d make the observation in a more general sense oall observations are made by human beings and therefore made with varioubiases but here your message leaves talk of hypothesis and gets back once again to equating the business of science with the end result the gizmo produced science works very well at developing theorie within paradigms but is very poor at dealing with paradigm shifts if i develop a novel paradigm that explains homeopathy chinese medicine or spontaneous combustion if the paradigm is useful it will show me the wa to make observations that prove or disprove itmy point isn t so much whether or not you have a novel paradigm but how you come about developing it the paradigm of modern medicine is that the body can be reduced to a set o essentially mechanical operations wherein disease is seen as malfunctions i the machinery essentially the old newtonian model of the world it seem likely that theories based upon this paradigm do not give a complete discription of the universe medicine healing etc indeed we now recognize an important psychological component to healing perhaps you d admit that this is an oversimplification on your part the topiof the philosophy of science is made for them i m making them too but think that it also summarizes popular misconceptions of science and thebusiness of doing science biomedical research doesn t make any basicassumptions that aren t the same as any other discipline of scientifiresearch that is that you make empirical observations form an hypothesiand test it modern medicine has much more to do with biochemistry than the old newtonian model of the world and i doubt that many psychologistwould appreciate being put outside this empirical world view psychologalso has more to do with biochemistry than spoon bending it is also important to distinguish reason from science science may b reasonable but so are many non scientific methodologies aristotle reasone that frogs came from mud by observing one hop out of a puddle oversimplified of course but a good example this is an empirical observation it was then tested though perhaps not by aristotle and eventuallyfound wanting in the meantime some folk willhave continued to believe in the spontaneous generation of animal life there s nothing at all surprising about this it s the way the gathering oknowledge works there are probably more than a few things in my owndiscipline of molecular biology that will be found to be totally off baseeven idiotic to someone in the future these future people won t have comto these relevations because they had suddenly gone all zen like and hada vision in an lsd trip someone will have thought of something new andtested it this is the bit that people who seem to relish misrepresentinscience and research can t seem to wrap their minds around science is acreative process what i think of as factual and good research can be totallturned on its head tommorrow by new results and theories again i think it gets down to defining what you mean by science i oftedon t recognize what it is that i do and am involved in in the way sciencis portrayed by popular media or writings of people in the humanities theportray science as a collection of immutable facts pronouncements of trutin big gold letters that s silly its as though we just go into the labturn over a stone and come up with a mechanism for transcriptional regulation its much more interesting than that it really is a very humaprocess
