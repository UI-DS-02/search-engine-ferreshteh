just had the opportunity to watch this flick on ae some 15 yearsince i saw it last wow the wwii channel did something notwwiii was very interested in the technology demonstrated in this filfor handling infectious diseases and similar toxic substancesclearly they faked a lot of the computer robotic technologycertainly at the time it was made most of that was science fictioitself let alone the idea of a space germ the graphics capabilities of the computers were very faked for movieaudiences who have not ability or patience with numbers the book was morerealistic in that respect in all respects actually the robotics arestill out of range but not impossiblequite coincidentally actually this is what got me wanted to sethe movie again i watched a segment on the otherwise awful howthey do that dealing with a disease researcher at the cdcs tolab there was description of the elaborate security measures takeso that building will never be cracked so to speak by man onature short of deliberate bombing from the air perhaps anthe researchers used spacesuits similar to that in the filmsf and ive always wondered how crichton escapes this classification isusually ahead of science in both prediction and precaution nasasdecontaimination processes were supposedly taken to prevent sf storydisasters i mean nasa scientists were often sf readers andsometimes writers and felt prewarned by their readingim curious what people think about this film short of sillyis such a facility technically feasible today i think the film still holds up among the best of sf films but that isntsaying a whole lotas far as the plot and the crystalline structure that is not lifas we know it thats a whole nother argument for recartssftecor somethingyep
