dyer spdcc com steve dyer writes there is no convincing evidence that such a disease exists there s a lot of evidence it just hasn t been adequately gathered an published in a way that will convince the die hard melancholic skeptic who quiver everytime the word anecdote or empirical is used snort ah there go my sinuses again for example dr ivker who wrote the book sinus survival always gives oh wow a classic textbook hey they laughed at einstein too before any other treatment a systemic anti fungal such as nizoral to hi new patients if they ve been on braod spectrum anti biotics 4 or more time in the last two years he s kept a record of the results and for over 2000 patients found that over 90 of his patients get significant relie of allergic sinus symptoms of course this is only the beginning for hi program yeah i ll bet tomorrow the world listen uncontrolled studies like this are worthless in my case as i reported a few weeks ago i was developing the classi symptoms outlined in the yeast connection i agree it is a poorly written book e g extreme sensitivity to plastics vapors etc whic i never had before started in november within one week of full dosag of sporanox the sensitivity to chemicals has fully disappeared i ca now sit on my couch at home without dying after two minutes i m als greatly improved in other areas as well i m sure you are you sound like the typical hysteric hypochondriac wh responds to miracle cures of course i have allergy symptoms etc i am especially allergic t molds yeasts etc it doesn t take a rocket scientist to figure out tha if one has excessive colonization of yeast in the body and you have natural allergy to yeasts that a threshold would be reached where yo would have perceptible symptoms yeah it makes sense to me so of course it should be taken seriously snort also yeast do produce toxins of variou sorts and again you don t have to be a rocket scientist to realize tha such toxins can cause problems in some people yeah it sounds reasonable to me of course the 60 00 question is whether a person who is immune compromised as tests showed i wa from over 5 years of antibiotics nutritionally deficiencies because of th stress of infections and allergies etc oh really what tests immune compromised my ass more like credulous malingerer this is a psychiatric syndrome can develop excessive yeas colonization somewhere in the body it is a tough question to answer sinc testing for excessive yeast colonization is not easy one almost has t take an empirical approach to diagnosis fortunately sporanox is relativel safe unlike past anti fungals still have to be careful however so there no reason any longer to withhold sporanox treatment for empirical reasons you know it s a shame that a drug like itraconazole is being misuse in this way it s ridiculously expensive and potentially toxic the trouble is that it isn t toxic enough so it gets abused by quacks btw some would say to try nystatin unfortunately most yeast grows hypha too deep into tissue for nystatin to have any permanent affect you ll fin a lot of people who are on nystatin all the time the only good thing about nystatin is that it s relatively chea and when taken orally non toxic but oral nystatin is without an systemic effect so unless it were given iv it would be withou any effect on your sinuses i wish these quacks would first us iv nystatin or amphotericin b on people like you that would solv the yeast problem once and for all in summary i appreciate all of the attempts by those who desire to kee medicine on the right road but methinks that some who hold too firml to the party line are academics who haven t been in the trenches long enoug actually treating patients if anybody doctors included said to me to m face that there is no evidence of the yeast connection i cannot guarante their safety for their incompetence ripping off their lips is justified a far as i am concerned perhaps a little haldol would go a long way towards amelioratin your symptoms are you paying for this treatment out of your own pocket i d hat to think my insurance premiums are going towards this steve dyedyer you re rude medicine is not a totallly scientific endevour it often practiced in a disorganized manner most early treatment onon life threatening illness is done on a guess hazarded after anecdotaevidence given by the patient it s an educated guess by a trained personbut it s still no more than a guessit s cheaper and simpler to medicate first and only deal further with thospeople who don t respondthere are diseases that haven t been described yet and the root cause of mandiseases now described aren t known read a book on gastroenterologsometime if you want to see a lot of them after scientific methods havrun out then it s the patient s freedom of choice to try any experimentamethod they choose and it s well recognized by many doctors that medicindoesn t have all the answersthis person said that they had relief by taking the medicine maybe it s miracle cure maybe it s valid how do you know you might argue with the reasoning the conclusions but your disparaginattack is unwarranted why don t you present an convincing argument for yor beliefs instead of wasting our time in an ad hominem attack jackie
