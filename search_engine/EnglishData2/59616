being a chronic hbsag carrier does not necessarily mean the patient has chronipersistent anything persons who are chronic carriers may have no clinicalbiochemical or histologic evidence of liver disease or they may have chronipersistent hepatitis chronic active hepatitis cirrhosis or hepatocellulacarcinomamost cases of chronic persistent hepatitis cph are probably the result oa viral infection although in a good number of cases the cause cannot bdetermined the diagnosis of cph is made on the basis of liver biopsy iconsists of findings of portal inflammation an intact periportal limitinplate and on occasion isolated foci of intralobular necrosis but in contrasto chronic active hepatitis cah there is no periportal inflammationbridging necrosis or fibrosiscph has indeed an excellent prognosis if i had to choose between cah ancph there is no question i would also choose cph however as david pointeout the distinction between the two is not as neat as some of us would havit the histology can sometimes be pretty equivocal with biopsies showinareas compatible with both cph and cah maybe it is a sampling problem maybit is a continuum i dont knowdarn just when i think i understand something someone who knows thpathology has to burst my bubble wed better not start talking abouglomerular diseases then ill really get depressedseriously though i wonder how someone with cph would end up getting biopsy in the first place my understanding and feel free to correct meis that the enzymes are at worst mildly elevated with overall normahepatic function i would think that the only clue might be a history oprior hepb infection and a positive hepbsag or is it indeed on continuum with cah and the distinction merely one of pathology anprognosis but otherwise identical clinical features kenneth gilbert university of pittsburgh general internal medicine dammit not a programmer
