seriously though i wonder how someone with cph would end up getting biopsy in the first place my understanding and feel free to correct meis that the enzymes are at worst mildly elevated with overall normahepatic function i would think that the only clue might be a history oprior hepb infection and a positive hepbsag or is it indeed on continuum with cah and the distinction merely one of pathology anprognosis but otherwise identical clinical featureschronic persistent hepatitis is usually diagnosed when someone does a livebiopsy on a patient that has persistently elevated serum transaminases monthafter a bout of acute viral hepatitis or when someone is found to havpersistently elevated transaminases on routine screening tests the degree oelevation in the serum transaminases can be trivial or as much as ten timenormal other blood chemistries are usually normalas a rule patients with cph have no clinical signs of liver diseasechronic active hepatitis can also be asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic aleast initially and thats why its important to tell them apart by means oa biopsy the patient with cph only needs to be reassured the patient witcah needs to be treatedhoward doyldoylepitted
