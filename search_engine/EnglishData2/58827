what is wrong with the above observation is that it explicitly gives th impression and you may not in fact hold this view that the common perhap even the correct approach for a scientist to follow is to sit aroun having flights of fancy and scheming on the basis of his jealousies an petty hatredsflights of fancy and other irrational approaches are common the cruciathing is not to sit around just having fantasies they aren t of any usunless they make you do some experiments i ve known a lot of scientistwhose fantasies lead them on to creative work usually they won t admiout loud what the fantasy was prior to the consumption of a few beers simple example warren jelinek noticed an extremely heavy band on a dnelectrophoresis gel of human alu fragments he got very excited hoping thahe d seen some essential part of the control mechanism for eukaryotigenes this fantasy led him to sequence samples of the band and carry oubinding assays the result was a well conserved 400 or so bp sequencthat occurs about 500 000 times in the human genome unfortunately fowarren s fantasy it turns out to be a transposon that is present iso many copies because it replicates itself and copies itself back intthe genome on the other hand the characteristics of transposons wermuch elucidated the necessity of a cellular reverse transcriptase warecognized and the standard method of recognizing human dna was createdother species have different sets of transposons fortunately for mewarren and i used to eat dinner at t g i fridays all the time it further at least implicitly advances the position tha sciences goes forward and it is not clear what this means given th context in which it occurs by generating in a completely non rationa and even random way a plethora of hypotheses and theories that are the weeded out via the critical function of sciencei m not sure that it s random but there is no known rational mechanisfor generating a rich set of interesting hypotheses if you are reallworking in an unknown area it is unlikely that you will have much sensof what might or might not be true under those circumstances the besthing to do is just follow whatever instincts you have if they are wrongyou will find out soon enough but at least you will find out something if you try to do experiments at random with no prior conceptions at alin mind you will probably get nowhere though why this critica function should be less subject to the non rational forces is a mysteryunfortunately the critical function does sometimes become hostage tnon rational forces then we get varieties of pathological sciencelysenko mirsky s opposition to dna as gene cold fusion and so forth if experimental design hypotheses creation and theory construction ar subject to jealousies and petty hatreds then this must be equally tru of the application of any critical function concerning replication this is what leads one ala feyerabend to an anything goes view i don t agree that this follows in fact this is exactly the point awhich i disagree with feyerabend it is a most important part of thculture of science that one keeps one s jealousies out of the refereeinprocess failures there are aplenty but on the whole things work outanother point there are a couple of senses of the phrase experimentadesign i d say that the less rational part is in experimental choice not design alexander fleming proc royal soc 1922 chose to look fobacteriophage in his own mucus for strange reasons phage had previouslbeen found in locust diarrhea fleming probably thought runny bottom runnnose what the hell it s worth a try but his method of looking for phagwas well designed to detect anything phage like in fact he found lysozyme true the generation part can be totally irrational but typically it i not anecdotes concerning instances where a hypothesis seems to hav resulted in some way from a dream or from one s political views simpl do not generalize well to the actual history of scienceit is not clear to me what you mean by rational vs irrational perhapyou can give a few examples of surprising experiments that were tried oufor perfectly rational reasons or interesting new theories that were firsadvanced from logical grounds the main examples i can think of are fromodern high energy physics which is not typical of science as a whole mark a fulk t t tuniversity of rochestecomputer science department tfulk cs rochester ed
