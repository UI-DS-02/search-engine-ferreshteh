being a chronic hbsag carrier does not necessarily mean the patient has chroni persistent anything persons who are chronic carriers may have no clinical biochemical or histologic evidence of liver disease or they may have chroni persistent hepatitis chronic active hepatitis cirrhosis or hepatocellula carcinoma most cases of chronic persistent hepatitis cph are probably the result o a viral infection although in a good number of cases the cause cannot b determined the diagnosis of cph is made on the basis of liver biopsy i consists of findings of portal inflammation an intact periportal limitin plate and on occasion isolated foci of intralobular necrosis but in contras to chronic active hepatitis cah there is no periportal inflammation bridging necrosis or fibrosis cph has indeed an excellent prognosis if i had to choose between cah an cph there is no question i would also choose cph however as david pointe out the distinction between the two is not as neat as some of us would hav it the histology can sometimes be pretty equivocal with biopsies showin areas compatible with both cph and cah maybe it is a sampling problem mayb it is a continuum i don t knowdarn just when i think i understand something someone who knows thpathology has to burst my bubble we d better not start talking abouglomerular diseases then i ll really get depressedseriously though i wonder how someone with cph would end up getting biopsy in the first place my understanding and feel free to correct meis that the enzymes are at worst mildly elevated with overall normahepatic function i would think that the only clue might be a history oprior hepb infection and a positive hepb sag or is it indeed on continuum with cah and the distinction merely one of pathology anprognosis but otherwise identical clinical features kenneth gilbert university of pittsburgh general internal medicine dammit not a programmer
