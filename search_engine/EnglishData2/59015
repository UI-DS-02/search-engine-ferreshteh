a bit more than a year ago a hernia in my right groin wa discovered it had produced a dull pain in that area the herni was repaired using the least intrusive orthoscopic method and plug and patch i suspect you mean laparoscopic instead of orthoscopic now the pain occurs more often my gp couldn t identify an specific problem the surgen who performed the original procedur now says that yes there is a new hernia in the same area and h said that he has to cut into the area for the repair this time my question to the net is there a nonintrusive method t determine if in fact there is a hernia or if the pain is fro something elseby far the still best method to diagnose a hernia is old fashionephysical examination if you have an obvious hernia sac coming downinto your scrotum or a bulge in your groin that is brought about bincreasing intra abdominal pressure sometimes is not that obvious the hernia is small and you can onlydetect it by putting your finger into the inguinal canal whether you have a recurrent hernia or this is related to the previouoperation i can t tell you the person that examined you is in the besposition to make that determinationare there non invasive ways of diagnosing a hernia every now and thenfolks write about ct scans and ultrasounds for this but these are fatoo expensive and unlikely to be better than a trained examining finger howard doyldoyle pitt ed
