gary merrill writes mark fulk writes flights of fancy and other irrational approaches are common the crucia thing is not to sit around just having fantasies they aren t of any us unless they make you do some experiments simple example warren jelinek noticed an extremely heavy band on a dn electrophoresis gel of human alu fragments he got very excited but why do you characterize this as a flight of fancy or a fantasy while i am unfamiliar with the scientific context here it appears obviou that his speculation for lack of a better or more neutral word wa at least in significant part a consequence of his knowledge of and acceptanc of current theory coupled with his observations it would appear tha something quite rational was going on as he attempted to fit his observatio into that theory or to tailor the theory to cover the observation whether a scientific idea comes while one is staring out the window odreaming or having a fantasy or watching an apple fall newton ositting in a bath archimedes it is ultimately the result of a lot ointense scientific thinking done beforehand letting one s mind roafreely and giving rein to one s intuition can be a useful way of cominup with new ideas but only when one has done a lot of rational analysiof the problem first scientific intuition is not something one is born with it is somethinthat one learns maybe we don t understand completely how it is learnedbut training in systematic scientific thinking is certainly one of thekey elements in developing it informal exploration is also often an important element in finding nescientific ideas one thinks for instance of darwin s naturalististudies in the galapagos islands which led him to the ideas for thetheory of evolution this is why i am offended by a definition of science that emphasizeempirical verification and does not recognize thinking and informaexploration as important scientific work i agree that mere speculatiodoes not deserve to be called science i also think that mere empiricastudies not directed by good scientific thinking are at best a verpoor kind of science russell turpin writes i think that lee lady and i are talking at cross purposes lady seems concerned with the contrast between grea science that makes big advances in our knowledge and mediocr science that makes smaller steps in most of this thread i hav been concerned with the difference between what is science an what is not i don t think that science should be defined in a way that some of thactivities that lead to really important science namely thinking aninformal exploration are not recognized as scientific work in the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists psychology seemsless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects lady uhunix uhcc hawaii edu lady uhunix bitne
