explain i thought there were 3 types of cones equivalent to rgb you re basically right but i think there are just 2 types one i sensitive to red and green and the other is sensitive to blue and yellow this is why the two most common kinds of color blindness are red green an blue yellow yes i remember that now well in that case the cones are indee color sensitive contrary to what the original respondent had claimed ti m not sure who the original respondent was but treiterate cones respond to particular portions of the spectrum jusas rods respond to certain parts of the visible spectrum bluegreein our case reddish in certain amphibia just as the hoseshoe cra limulus polyphemus photoreceptors respond to a certain portion othe spectrum etc it is a common misconception to confound wavelengtspecificity with being color sensitive however the two are nosynonymous tso in sum and to beat a dead horse t 1 when the outputs of a cone are matched for number oabsorbed photons irrespective of the absorbed photons wavelengththe cone outputs are indistinguishable t 2 cones are simply detectors with different spectrasensitivities and are not any more color sensitive than are rodsommatidia or other photoreceptors t 3 color vision arises because outputs of receptors whicsample different parts of the spectrum cones in this case ar processed centrally the handwave is intentional ti ve worked and published research on rods and cones for ove10 years so the adherence to the belief that cones can detect coloris frustrating but don t take my word for it i m reposting a feexcellent articles together with two rather good but oldish colovision textsthe textsrobert boynton 1979 human color vision holt rhiehart and winstoleo m hurvich 1981 color vision sinauer associatesthe original articlesbaylor and hodgkin 1973 detection and resolution of visual stimuli bturtle phoreceptors j physiol 234 pp163 198baylor lamb and yau 1978 reponses of retinal rods to single photons j physiol 288 pp613 634schnapf et al 1990 visual transduction in cones of the monke macaca fascicularis j physiol 427 pp681 713 edwin barkdolbarkdoll lepomis psych upenn edeb3 world std co edwin barkdoleb3 world std co
