hbloom moose uvm edu heather writes nutrasweet is a synthetic sweetener a couple thousand times sweeter tha sugar some people are concerned about the chemicals that the body produces when it degrades nutrasweet it is thought to form formaldehyde and known t for methanol in the degredation pathway that the body uses to eliminate substances the real issue is whether the levels of methanol and formaldehyd produced are high enough to cause significant damage as both are toxic t living cells all i can say is that i will not consume it phenylalanine i nothing for you to worry about it is an amino acid and everyone uses smal quantities of it for protein synthesis in the body some people have a diseas known as phenylketoneurea and they are missing the enzyme necessary to degrade this compound and eliminate it from the body for them it will accumulate in the body and in high levels this is toxic to growing nerv cells therefore it is only a major problem in young children until aroun age 10 or so or women who are pregnant and have this disorder it used t be a leading cause of brain damage in infants but now it can be easily detected at birth and then one must simply avoid comsumption of phenylalanin as a child or when pregnant heatheif i remember rightly pku syndrome in infants is about 1 1200 they lactwo genes and people who lack one gene are supposed to be 1 56 personsthose with pku have to avoid naturally occuring phenylalanine and thoswho only have one gene and underproduce whatever it is they are supposed tbe producing are supposed to be less tolerant of aspartame the methol formaldahyde thing was supposed to occur with heatingi don t drink it i figure sugar was made for a reason to quickly aneasily satiate hungry people if you don t need the calories it s just aeasy to drink water used to drink a six pack a aday of aspartame soda don even drink one coke a day when sugared
