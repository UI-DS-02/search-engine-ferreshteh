jacquier gsbux1 uchicago edu eric jacquier says from now on it looks like 2 shots per week fo 6 months followed by 1 shot per month or so each shot cost 20 talking about soaring costs and the health care system i woul call that a racket we are not talking about rare amazonian grasse here but the garbage which grows behind the doctor s office apart from this issue i was somewhat disappointed to find ou that you have to keep getting the shots forever is that rightyou might look for an allergy doctor in your area who uses sublinguadrops instead of shots for treatment you are given a small bottle oantigens 3 drops are placed under the tongue for 5 minutes mallergy to bermuda grass was neutralized this way throughout the treatmenprocess i had to return to the doctor s office every month for re testinand a new bottle of antigens after the allergy was completely neutralizea bottle of maintenance antigens lasts me about 4 months the sublinguadrops are then taken 3 times per week and costs 20 so the cost iless than shots and it is more convenient just to take the drops at homebruce lon
