ps may i suggest seriously that if the doctors and wannabedoctors othe net who refuse to have an open mind on alternative treatments antheories such as the yeast theory should create your own moderated groupwhy is there some reason why you feel that it shouldnt be pointed ouin scimed that there is no convincing empirical evidence to support theexistence of systemic yeast syndromei dont know the first thing about yeast infections but i am a scientistno scientist would take your statement no convincing empirical evidencto support the existence of systemic yeast syndrome to tell yoanything except an absence of data on the question noring has pointed outhe catch22 that if the crazy theory were true you probably couldnfind any direct evidence of it that you couldnt observe those yeastibeasties with present methods even if they were there noring and thfellow from oklahoma sorry forgot your name have also suggested one seof anecdotal evidence in favor based on their personal experiences namely that when people with certain conditions are given antifungalsmany of them appear to get better so if you have any evidence against the hypothesis for examplecontrolled doubleblind studies showing that the antifungals dont do anbetter than sugar water then lets hear it if you dont then what whave is anecdotal and uncontrolled evidence on one side and abjecdisbelief on the other in which case please there is no point in yellinback and forth at each other any longer since neither side has anconvincing evidence either positive or negative and i understand that your abject disbelief is based on the existence opeople who may get famous or make money applying the diagnosis to everythinin sight making wild claims with no evidence and always refusing to dcontrolled studies but that has absolutely no bearing on the apparentlsincere experiences of the people on the net observing antifungals workinon themselves and other people in certain specific cases there are alsquacks who sell oral superoxide dismutase in spite of the fact that itcompletely broken down in the guts but this doesnt change the genuinscientific knowledge about the role of superoxide dismutase in fightinoxidative damage same thing just cause there are candida quacks thadoesnt establish evidence against the candida hypothesis if theres somother reason besides the quacks if only anecdotal to think it could btrue then that is what has to be considered that is what the net peoplhave been talking aboutbut again there is no point in arguing about it there is anecdotaevidence and there is no convincing evidence and there are also somcandida quacks out there i hope everyone can agree on all of that thusit appears to me the main question now is whether the proponents camarshall enough anecdotal evidence in a convincing and documented enougmanner to make a good case for carrying out a good controlled doubleblinstudy of antifungals or else forget convincing anybody else to carry outhe test just carry it out themselves and also whether they caadequately define the patient population or symptoms on which such a studshould be carried out to provide a fair test of the hypothesiske
