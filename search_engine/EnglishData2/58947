russell turpin writes not imply that all their treatments are ineffective it does imply that those who rely on faulty methodology and reasoning ar incapable of discovering which treatments are effective an which are not to start with no methodology or form of reasoning is infallible sthere s a question of how much certainty we are willing to pay for in given context insistence on too much rigor bogs science down completeland makes progress impossible expenditure of sufficiently large sumof money and amounts of time can sometimes overcome this on the othehand with too little rigor much is lost by basing work on results whiceventually turn out to be false there is a morass of studiecontradicting other studies and outsiders start saying you people calthis science my opinion for what it s worth is that one sees botthese phenomena happening simultaneously in some parts of psychology some subjective judgement is required to decide on the level of rigoappropriate for a particular investigation i don t believe it isever possible to banish subjective judgement from science my second point though is that highly capable people can often makextremely reliable judgements about scientific validity even when usinmethodology considered inadequate by the usual standards i think thiis true of many scientists and i think it is true of many who approactheir discipline in a way that is not generally recognized as scientificwithin mathematics i think there are several examples especially beforthe twentieth century one conspicuous case is that of riemann who ifamous for many theorems he stated but did not prove latermathematicians did prove them of course i think that for a good scientist empirical investigation is often noso much a matter of determining what is true and what s not as it is amatter of convincing other people people have proposed lots ofincompatible definitions of science here but i think the ability toobjectively convince others of the validity of one s results is aessential element not that one can necessarily do that at every stepof the scientific process but i think that if one is not moving towardthat goal then one is not doing science when a person other than a scientist is quite good at what he does anseems to be very successful at it i think that his judgements are alsworthy of respect and that his assertions are well worth furtheinvestigation namely is there really justification for the belief tha science is a superior path to truth than non scientific approaches admittedly my question was not at all well posed a considerablamount of effort in a serious scholarly investigation such as suggested would be required simply to formulate an appropriatelyspecific question to try and answer the science i was thinking of in my question is the actual sciencecurrently practiced now in the last decade of the twentieth century i certainly wasn t thinking of some idealized science or the mere useof reason and observation one thing i had in mind in my suggestion was the question as to whethein many cases the subjective judgements of skilled and experiencepractitioners might be more reliable than statistical studies since russell turpin seems to be much more familiar than i am witthe study of scientific methodology perhaps he can tell us if thereis any existing research related to this question in the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists psychology seemsless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects lady uhunix uhcc hawaii edu lady uhunix bitne
