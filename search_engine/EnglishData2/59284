announced that it will soon publish newrules to shed the approval of drugs for patients with serious or lifethreatening illnesses such as aids cancer and alzheimer s disease these final rules will help patients who are suffering the most seriousillnesses to get access to new drugs months or even years earlier than wouldotherwise be possible said hhs secretary louis w sullivan m d the effortto accelerate fda review for these drugs has been a long term commitment andindeed a hallmark of this administration these rules establish procedures for the food and drug administration toapprove a drug based on surrogate endpoints or markers they apply when thedrug provides a meaningful benefit over currently available therapies suchendpoints would include laboratory tests or physical signs that do not inthemselves constitute a clinical effect but that are judged by qualifiedscientists to be likely to correspond to real benefits to the patient use of surrogate endpoints for measurement of drug efficacy permits approvalearlier than if traditional endpoints such as relief of disease symptoms orprevention of disability and death from the disease are used the new rules provide for therapies to be approved as soon as safety andeffectiveness based on surrogate endpoints can be reasonably established the drug s sponsor will be required to agree to continue or conductpostmarketing human studies to confirm that the drug s effect on the surrogateendpoint is an indicator of its clinical effectiveness one new drug zalcitabine also called ddc was approved june 19 using amodel of this process for treating the human immunodeficiency virus hiv thecause of aids accelerated approval can also be used if necessary when fda determines thata drug judged to be effective for the treatment of a disease can be usedsafely only under a restricted distribution plan the new rules will help streamline the drug development and review processwithout sacrificing goad science and rigorous fda oversight said fdacommissioner david a kessler m d while drug approval will be accomplishedfaster these drugs and biological products must still meet safety andeffectiveness standards required by law hicnet medical newsletter page 1volume 6 number 11 april 25 199the new procedures also allow for a streamlined withdrawal process if thepostmarketing studies do not verify the drug s clinical benefit if there isnew

photoreceptor cells in animal test baltimore md researchers at the university of california san franciscoand regeneron pharmaceuticals inc nasdaq regn have discovered thatcertain naturally occurring substances known as neurotrophic factors canprevent the degeneration of light sensing cells in the retina of the eye thedegeneration of these cells known as photoreceptors is a major cause ofvisual impairment this research published to in the december issue of the proceedings ofthe national academy of science pnas holds promise for people who may losetheir sight due to progressive retinal degeneration currently no drugtreatment for retinal degeneration exists it is estimated that 2 5 millionamericans have severe vision loss due to age related macular degeneration and100 000 americans are affected by retinitis pigmentosus a hereditary diseasethat causes blindness in addition each year more than 15 000 people undergosurgical procedures to repair retinal detachments and other retinal

from ucsf in the research described in the pnas a light damage model was used toassess the survival promoting activity of a number of naturally occurringsubstances experimental rats were exposed to constant light for one week eyes that had not been treated with an effective factor lost most of theirphotoreceptor cells the rods and cones of the retina after lightexposure brain derived neurotrophic factor bdnf and ciliary neurotrophicfactor cntf were particularly effective in this model without causingunwanted side effects other factors such as nerve growth factor ngf andinsulin like growth factor igf 1 were not effective in these experiments discussing the research dr jesse m cedarbaum regeneron s director ofclinical research said bdnf s ability to rescue neurons in the

weidema nov dec 199 national institutes of healt high fat high calorie diets rapidly increase risk factors for coronaryheart disease in native populations of developing countries that havetraditionally consumed diets low in fat these findings according toinvestigators at the oregon health sciences university in portland haveserious implications for public health in both industrialized and developingcountries this study demonstrates why we can develop coronary heart disease andhave higher blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels it shows also theimportance of diet and particularly the potential of the diet to increase bodyweight thereby leading to a whole host of other health problems in developingcountries and affluent nations as well explains principal investigator dr william e connor head of the section of clinical nutrition and lipidmetabolism at oregon health sciences university over the past 25 years dr connor and his team have characterized thefood and nutrient intakes of the tara humara indians in mexico whilesimultaneously documenting various aspects of tarahumara lipid metabolism these native mexicans number approximately 50 000 and reside in the sierramadre occidental mountains in the state of chihuahua the tarahumaras havecoupled an agrarian diet to endurance racing probably as a result coronaryheart disease which is so prevalent in western industrialized nations isvirtually non existent in their culture loosely translated the nametarahumara means fleet of foot reflecting a tribal passion for betting on kickball races in which participants run distances of 100 miles or morewhile kicking a machete carved wooden ball the typical tarahumara diet consists primarily of pinto beans tortillas and pinole a drink made of ground roasted corn mixed with cold water together with squash and gath ered fruits and vegetables the tara humarasalso eat small amounts of game fish and eggs their food containsapproximately 12 percent of total calories as fat of which the majority 69percent is of vegetable origin dietician martha mcmurry a coinvestigatorin the study describes their diet as simple and very rich in nutrients whilelow in cholesterol and fat the tarahumaras have average plasma cholesterol levels of 121 mg dl low density lipoprotein ldl cholesterol levels of 72 mg dl and high densitylipoprotein hdl cholesterol levels of 32 to 42 mg dl all of those valuesare in the good low risk range according to the researchers elevatedcholesterol and ldl cholesterol levels are considered risk factors for hearthicnet medical newsletter page 2volume 6 number 11 april 25 199disease hdl cholesterol is considered beneficial in previous studies thetarahumaras had been found to be at low risk for cardiac disease althoughable to respond to high cholesterol diets with elevations in total and ldlcholesterol clinical research center dietitian mcmurry and coinvestigator mariateresa cerqueira established a metabolic unit in a jesuit mission schoolbuilding near a community hospital in the small village of sisoguichi foodwas weighed cooked and fed to the study participants under theinvestigators direct supervision ensuring that subjects ate only foodstipulated by the research protocol fasting blood was drawn twice weekly and plasma samples were frozen and shipped to dr connors laboratory forcholesterol triglyceride and lipoprotein analyses regular measurementsincluded participant body weight height and triceps skin fold thickness thirteen tarahumaras five women and eight men including one adolescent werefed their native diet for 1 week followed by 5 weeks of an affluent diet in this study we went up to a concentration of dietary fat that was 40percent of total calories this is the prototype of the holiday diet thatmany americans consume a diet high in fat sugar and cholesterol low infiber elaborates dr conners such dietary characteristics are reflected inthe cholesterol saturation index or csi recently devised research dietitiansonja conner working with dr connor the csi is a single number thatincorporates both the amount of cholesterol and the amount of saturated fat inthe diet csi indicates the diet s potential to elevate the cholesterollevel particularly the ldl dr connor explains the tarahumaran dietaverages a very low csi of 20 dr connor s affluent diet used in the studyranks a csi of 149 the experimental design of this study reflects the importance ofestablishing baseline plasma lipid levels typical of the native diet beforeexposing subjects to the experimental diet the standard curve relatingdietary food intake to plasma cholesterol demonstrates a leveling off orplateau for consumption of large amounts of fat changes in dietary fatand or cholesterol in this range have little effect on plasma levels youmust have the baseline diet almost free of the variables you are going to putinto the experimental diet the framingham study for example did notdiscriminate on the basis of diet between individuals who got heart diseasebecause the diet was already high in fat all subjects were already eating ona plateau dr connor says after 5 weeks of consuming the affluent diet the subjects mean plasmacholesterol levels had in creased by 31 percent primarily in the ldlfraction which rose 39 percent hdl cholesterol increased by 31 per cent and ldl to hdl ratios changed therefore very little plasma triglyceridelevels increased by 18 percent and subjects averaged an 8 pound gain inweight according to dr connor lipid changes occurred surprisingly soon yielding nearly the same results after 7 days of affluent diet as after 35days hicnet medical newsletter page 2volume 6 number 11 april 25 199 the increase in hdl carries broad dietary implications for industrializednations we think hdl cholesterol increased because we increased the amountof dietary fat over the fat content used in the previous tarahumara metabolicstudy in that study we saw no change in hdl levels after raising the dietarycholesterol but keeping the fat relatively consistent with native consumption in the present study we increased fat intake to 40 percent of the totalcalories we reached the conclusion in the tarahumara study that hdl reflectsthe amount of dietary fat in general and not the amount of dietarycholesterol hdl must increase to help metabolize the fat and it increasedquite a bit in this study dr connor explains low hdl in the tarahumarans is not typically an important predictor ofcoronary heart disease because they do not normally consume large amounts offat or cholesterol hdl remains an important predictor to americans becauseof their usual high fat intake dr connor recommends a diet for americans that contains less than 20percent of total calories as fat less than 100 mg of cholesterol and a csiaround 20 varying in accordance with caloric needs such a diet is low inmeat and dairy fat high in fiber dr connor also comments on recentsuggestions that americans adopt a mediterranean style diet the originalmediterranean diet in its pristine state consisted of a very low intake offat and very few animal and dairy products we are already eating a lot ofmeat and dairy products simply to continue that pattern while switching toolive oil is not going to help the situation the world health organization who is focusing much attention on theemergence of diseases such as coronary heart disease in nations and societiesundergoing technological development dr connor says that coronary heartdisease starts with a given society s elite who typically eat a differentdiet than the average citizen if the pattern of afluence increases theentire population will have have a higher incidence of coronary heart disease which places a termendous health care burden on a society who would like thedeveloping countries to prevent coronary heart disease so they canconcentrate on other aspects of their economic development and on publichealth measures to improve general well being rather than paying forunnecessary expensive medical technology dr connors says the overall implication of this study is that humans can readily movetheir plasma lipids and lipoprotein values into a high risk range within avery short time by an affluent excessive diet the present rate of coronaryheart disease in the united states is 30 percent less than it was 20 yearsago so a lot has been accomplished we are changing rapidly he concludeshicnet medical newsletter page 2volume 6 number 11 april 25 199 general announcment publications
