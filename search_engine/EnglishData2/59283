prevention mmw rates of cesarean delivery united states 199 source mmwr 42 15 date apr 23 199 cesarean deliveries have accounted for nearly 1 million of theapproximately 4 million annual deliveries in the united states since 1986 table 1 the cesarean rate in the united states is the third highest among21 reporting countries exceeded only by brazil and puerto rico 1 thisreport presents data on cesarean deliveries from cdc s national hospitaldischarge survey nhds for 1991 and compares these data with previous years data on discharges from short stay nonfederal hospitals have beencollected annually since 1965 in the nhds conducted by cdc s national centerfor health statistics for 1991 medical and demographic information wereabstracted from a sample of 274 000 inpatients discharged from 484participating hospitals the 1991 cesareans and vaginal births after a priorcesarean vbac presented in this report are based on weighted nationalestimates from the nhds sample of approximately 31 000 11 women dischargedafter delivery the estimated numbers of live births by type of delivery werecalculated by applying cesarean rates from the nhds to live births fromnational vital registration data therefore estimates of the number ofcesareans in this report will not agree with previously published data basedsolely on the nhds 2 stated differences in this analysis are significant atthe 95 confidence level based on the two tailed t test with a critical valueof 1 96 in 1991 there were 23 5 cesareans per 100 deliveries the same rate asin 1990 and similar to rates during 1986 1989 table 1 the primary cesareanrate i e number of first cesareans per 100 deliveries to women who had noprevious cesareans for 1986 1991 also was stable ranging from 16 8 to 17 5 in 1991 the cesarean rate in the south was 27 6 significantly p 0 05 higher than the rates for the west 19 8 midwest 21 8 and northeast 22 6 rates were higher for mothers aged greater than or equal to 30 yearsthan for younger women in proprietary hospitals than in nonprofit orgovernment hospitals in hospitals with fewer than 300 beds than in largerhospitals and for deliveries for which blue cross blue shield and otherprivate insurance is the expected source of payment than for other sources ofpayment table 2 the same pattern characterized primary cesarean deliveries since the early 1970s the number and percentage of births to older womenincreased however if the age distribution of mothers in 1991 had remainedthe same as in 1986 the overall cesarean rate in 1991 would have been 23 3 essentially the same as the 23 5 observed based on the nhds of the approximately 4 111 000 live births in 1991 anhicnet medical newsletter page volume 6 number 11 april 25 199estimated 966 000 23 5 were by cesarean delivery of these an estimated338 000 35 0 births were repeat cesareans and 628 000 65 0 were primarycesareans since 1986 approximately 600 000 primary cesareans have beenperformed annually in 1986 8 5 of women who had a previous cesareandelivered vaginally compared with 24 2 in 1991 of all cesareans in 1991 35 0 were associated with a previous cesarean 30 4 with dystocia i e failure of labor to progress 11 7 with breech presentation 9 2 with fetaldistress and 13 7 with all other specified complications the average hospital stay for all deliveries in 1991 was 2 8 days incomparison the hospital stay for a primary cesarean delivery was 4 5 days and for a repeat cesarean 4 2 days nearly twice the duration for vbacdeliveries 2 2 days or for vaginal deliveries that were not vbacs 2 3days in 1986 the average hospital stay for all deliveries was 3 2 days forprimary cesareans 5 2 days for repeat cesareans 4 7 days and for vbac andnon vbac vaginal deliveries 2 7 and 2 6 days respectively reported by office of vital and health statistics systems national centerfor health statistics cdc editorial note the cesarean rate in the united states steadily increased from1965 through 1986 however the findings in this report indicate that rateshave been stable since 1986 3 because there is little evidence thatmaternal and child health status has improved during this time and becausecesareans are associated with an increased risk for complications ofchildbirth a national health objective for the year 2000 4 is to reduce theoverall cesarean rate to 15 or fewer per 100 deliveries and the primarycesarean rate to 12 or fewer per 100 deliveries objective 14 8 postpartum complications including urinary tract and wound infections may account in part for the longer hospital stays for cesarean deliveriesthan for vaginal births 5 moreover the prolonged hospital stays forcesarean deliveries substantially increase health care costs for example in1991 the average costs for cesarean and vaginal deliveries were 7826 and 4720 respectively the additional cost for each cesarean delivery includes 611 for physician fees and 2495 for hospital charges 6 if the cesareanrate in 1991 had been 15 the year 2000 objective instead of 23 5 the numberof cesarean births would have decreased by 349 000 617 000 versus 966 000 resulting in a savings of more than 1 billion in physician fees and hospitalcharges despite the steady increase in vbac rates since 1986 several factors mayimpede progress toward the year 2000 national health objectives for cesareandelivery for example vbac rates substantially reflect the number of womenoffered trial of labor which has been increasingly encouraged since 1982 7 of women who are offered a trial of labor 50 70 could deliver vaginally 7 a level already achieved by many hospitals 8 trial of labor was routinelyoffered in 46 of hospitals surveyed in 1984 the most recent year for whichhicnet medical newsletter page volume 6 number 11 april 25 199national data are available 9 when the vbac rate according to nhds data was 5 7 the year 2000 objective specifies a vbac rate of 35 based on allwomen who had a prior cesarean regardless of whether a trial of labor wasattempted to reach the overall cesarean rate goal however increases in thevbac rate will need to be combined with a substantial reduction in the primaryrate one hospital succeeded in reducing the rate of cesarean delivery byapplying objective criteria for the four most common indications for cesareandelivery by requiring a second opinion and by instituting a peer reviewprocess 10 other recommendations for decreasing cesarean delivery ratesinclude eliminating incentives for physicians and hospitals by equalizingreimbursement for vaginal and cesarean deliveries public dissemination ofphysician and hospital specific cesarean delivery rates to increase publicawareness of differences in practices and addressing malpractice concerns which may be an important factor in maintaining the high rates of cesareandelivery 4 reference1 notzon fc international differences in the use of obstetric interventions jama 1990 263 3286 91 2 graves ej nchs 1991 summary national

of malaria in africa has become achallenging and complex problem because of increasing drug resistance although the risk of acquiring malaria for u s citizens and their dependentsstationed overseas generally has been low this risk varies substantially andunpredictably during may 1992 the office of medical services department ofstate oms dos and cdc were notified of an increased number of malaria casesamong official u s personnel stationed in kampala uganda a review of thehealth records from the embassy health unit ehu in kampala indicated that 27cases of malaria were diagnosed in official personnel from march through june1992 compared with two cases during the same period in 1991 ehu oms dos andcdc conducted an investigation to confirm all reported malaria cases andidentify potential risk factors for malaria among u s embassy personnel thisreport summarizes the results of the investigation malaria blood smears from 25 of the 27 reported case patients wereavailable for review by

increase in malaria among u s personnel wasattributed to poor adherence to both recommended malaria chemoprophylaxisregimens and use of personal protection measures during a period of increasedmalaria transmission and intensified chloroquine resistance in sub saharanafrica the findings in this report underscore the need to provide initial andcontinued counseling regarding malaria prevention for

march 199 national institute of dental researc at the second international workshop on the oral manifestations of hivinfection held january 31 february 3 in san francisco participants exploredissues related to the epidemiology basic molecular virology mucosalimmunology and oral clinical presentations of hiv infection the workshop was organized by dr john greenspan and dr deborahgreenspan of the department of stomatology school of dentistry university ofcalifornia san francisco an international steering committee and scientificprogram committee provided guidance the conference drew more than 260 scientists from 39 countries includingasia africa europe central america south america as well as the unitedstates and canada support tor the workshop was provided by the nationalinstitute of dental research the national cancer institute the nationalinstitute of allergy and infectious diseases the nih office of aids research and the procter and gamble company among the topics discussed were the epidemiology of hiv lesions ethics professional responsibility and public policy occupational issues provisionof oral care to the hiv positive population salivary hiv transmission andmucosal immunity opportunistic infections pediatric hiv infection andwomen s issues recommendation recommendations emerged from the workshop to define the associationbetween the appearance of oral lesions and rate of progression of hiv toestablish a universal terminology for hiv associated oral lesions to look formore effective treatments for oral manifestations to expand molecular biologystudies to understand the relationship between hiv infection and common orallesions and to study the effects of hiv therapy on oral lesions epidemiolog since the first international workshop on oral manifestations of hivinfection was convened five years ago the epidemiology of hiv infection hashicnet medical newsletter page 1volume 6 number 11 april 25 199radically changed in 1988 hiv infection was detected and reported largelyin homosexual and bisexual males intravenous drug users and hemophiliacs today more hiv infection is seen in heterosexual males and females and inchildren and adolescents while the predominant impact of hiv infection has been felt in africa amajor increase in infection rate is being seen in southeast asia as well five hundred thousand cases have been reported to date in this region and moreare appearing all the time researchers are continuing to document the epidemiology of oral lesionssuch as hairy leukoplakia and candidiasis they also are beginning to explorethe relationships between specific oral lesions and hiv disease progressionand prognosis social political issue discussion on the social and political implications of hiv infectionfocused on changing the public s attitude that aids is retribution forindiscriminate sexual behavior and drug use speakers also addressed healthcare delivery for hiv infected patients and the need to educate the publicabout what aids is and how it is acquired saliva and salivary gland conference speakers described transmission issues and the hiv inhibitoryactivity of saliva the strength of which varies among the different salivarysecretions whole saliva has a greater inhibitory effect than submandibularsecretions which in turn have a greater inhibitory effect than parotidsecretions research has shown that at least two mechanisms are responsiblefor salivary inhibitory activity they attributed the hiv inhibitory effectof saliva to the 1 aggregation agglutination of hiv by saliva which may bothpromote clearance of virus and prevent it reaching a target cell and 2 direct effects on the virus or target cells other topics discussed were the manifestation of salivary gland diseasein hiv infected persons and current research on oral mucosal immunity pediatric issue pediatric aids recently has emerged as an area of intense interest withearly and accurate diagnosis and proper treatment the life expectancy of hivinfected children has tripled the prevention of transmission of hiv frommother to child may be possible in many cases particularly if the mother ssero status is known prior to giving birth periodontal and gingival tissue diseashicnet medical newsletter page 1volume 6 number 11 april 25 199 oral health researchers continue to explore periodontal diseases andgingivitis found in individuals with hiv infection recommendations made atthe workshop include the standardization of terminology refinement ofdiagnostic markers standardization of study design and proper considerationof confounding variables resulting from periodontal therapy occupational and treatment issue occupational issues surrounding the treatment of hiv infected individualsand treatment rendered by hiv infected health care professionals still commandconsiderable attention factors under consideration include the cost benefitof hiv testing patient to health care provider transmission of hiv infectionand the reverse and the use of mainstream versus dedicated facilities for thetreatment of hiv infected patients conference participants anticipate that a third international workshop
