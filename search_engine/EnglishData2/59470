recently ive come upon a body of literature which promotes colocleansing as a vital aid to preventive medicine through nutrition no doubt the scimed folks are getting out their flamethrowers i rather certain that the information you got was not medical literatur in the accepted academicscientific journals so the righteous amon them will no doubt jump on that also insofar as it doesnt conform to the accepted medical presumptio that it just doesnt matter what you eat and that we can think of th gi tract as a black box in which nothing ever goes wrong except fo maybe cancer and ulcers the righteous will no doubt jump on that too then therell be the ones who call your doctor a raving quack eve though he like linus pauling is lucid and robust well into hi ninetiesbut nevermind about that he shouldnt charge for hi equipment and supplies since theyre no doubt not approved by th fda of course with fda approval an md or pharmaceutical company ca charge whatever they can get for such safe and effective treatments a thalidomide but nevermind about that either unfortunately you dared to step into the sacred turf of netmedical discussion without a credential and without understanding that th righteous among them will make certain that you are suitably denounce before dismissing you as a fool but maybe somebody without such a huge chip on their shoulder wil send you some reasonable responses by email 12 12 oh yes i did have a point a few years ago an md with a thrivin practice in a very wealthy part of silicon valley once recommended tha i take such treatments to clear up a skin condition not through hi office i might add although im sure thats not conclusive it wa sure an unusual prescriptionthe bacteria in your gut are important but colonic flushes are not theway to improve gut function each person has almost a unique mix ofbacteria in hisher gut diet affects this mix as does the use ofantibiotics a diet change is a much better way to alter the players inyour gut than is colonic flushes cross contamination has been a realproblem in some of the outfits that do this treatment since the equipmentis not always cleaned as well as it should be between patient treatmentsdental drills have me a little concerned about hiv infection and ivepicked a dentist that uses both chemical and autoclave sterilization of hisinstrumentsmore clostly but much safer full sterile technique isalso used just like that practiced in an ormask gloves and gowns worn anddisposed of between patients each visit costs me 15 dollars more thanthe standard and customary fee so i have to pay it out of pocket his muchhigher fees do not drive away patientsi can not think of any good reason why someone should subject themselves tothis colonic flush procedure for very little if any benefit yousubject yourself to hepatitis cholera parasitic disease and even hivjust ask yourself why someone might resort to this kind of treatmentcould they be having gi distress could this distress be due to apathogenic organism could i get this organism if the equipment is notcleaned properly between patients do i really want to take this riskfood for thoughtmarty b
