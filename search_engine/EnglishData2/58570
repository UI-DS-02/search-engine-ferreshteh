i wrote or to use a phrasing that i think is more accurate science is the investigation of phenomena that avoids methods and reasoning that are known to be erroneous from past foul ups i can agree with this if you are talking about the less fundamenta aspects of scientific method in fact i don t see the alternative as i don t think that the fundamentals are capable of experimental investigation in sayin this i am agreeing with the work of people like kuhn 1970 feyerabend 1981 and lakatos 1972 while methodology cannot be subject to the same kind of experimenta investigation as that to which it is applied it can be criticall appraised methodologies can be compared to each other sometimes b the conflicting results they produce this kind of critical appraisa and comparison together with the inappropriateness of existin methodologies for new fields of study is what drives the evolution o methodologies and how we think about them as usual you are missing the whole point russell because you are nowilling to even consider questionning your basic article of faith whicis that science is merely a matter of methodology and that the highespurpose of science is to avoid making mistakes this is like saying that the most important aspect of business managemenis accurate bookkeeping if science were no more than methodology and not making mistakes iwould be a poor thing indeed what was the methodology of darwin whawas the methodology of einstein what was for that matter thmethodology of jenner and pasteur in an earlier article russell turpin writes none of the foregoing should be read as meaning that we shoul open the door to practitioners of quackery and psuedo science modern advocates of homeopathy chiropracty and traditiona chinese medicine receive little respect because for the mos part they use methods and reasoning that the kind of researc lee lady recommends has shown to be terribly faulty this doe not imply that all their treatments are ineffective it does imply that those who rely on faulty methodology and reasoning ar incapable of discovering which treatments are effective an which are not first of all i think you are arguing against a straw man because don t think that anyone here is arguing that quackery pseudo sciencehomeopathy chiropracty and traditional chinese medicine should baccepted as science i in particular think the basic ideas ohomeopathy and chiropracty seem extremely flaky what some of us do believe however is that some of these thing including some of the flaky ideas are deserving of serious scientifiattention if in fact it were true as you have stated above that those who do nouse the currently fashionable methodology can have no idea what ieffective and what is not then science today would not exist for alof current science is based on the past work of scientists whosmethodology by current standards was seriously flawed it is certainly true that as methodology improves we need to re examinthose results derived in the past using less perfect methodologies it ialso true that the results obtained by people today who still rely onthose early methodologies needs to be re examined in a more rigorousfashion by those qualified to do so credibly but to say that nobody who fails to do elaborate double blind studies icapable of knowing their ass from a hole in the ground and to say that nideas that come from outside the scientific establishment could possiblbe worthy of serious investigation this truly marks one s attitude adoctrinaire cultist this attitude is not compatible with a belief ireason in the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists psychology seemsless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects lady uhunix uhcc hawaii edu lady uhunix bitne
