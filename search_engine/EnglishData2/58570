i wrote or to use a phrasing that i think is more accurate science is the investigation of phenomena that avoids methods and reasoning that are known to be erroneous from past foulups i can agree with this if you are talking about the less fundamenta aspects of scientific method in fact i dont see the alternative as i dont think that the fundamentals are capable of experimental investigation in sayin this i am agreeing with the work of people like kuhn 1970 feyerabend 1981 and lakatos 1972 while methodology cannot be subject to the same kind of experimentainvestigation as that to which it is applied it can be criticallappraised methodologies can be compared to each other sometimes bthe conflicting results they produce this kind of critical appraisaand comparison together with the inappropriateness of existinmethodologies for new fields of study is what drives the evolution omethodologies and how we think about them as usual you are missing the whole point russell because you are nowilling to even consider questionning your basic article of faith whicis that science is merely a matter of methodology and that the highespurpose of science is to avoid making mistakes this is like saying that the most important aspect of business managemenis accurate bookkeeping if science were no more than methodology and not making mistakes iwould be a poor thing indeed what was the methodology of darwin whawas the methodology of einstein what was for that matter thmethodology of jenner and pasteur in an earlier article russell turpin writes none of the foregoing should be read as meaning that we shoulopen the door to practitioners of quackery and psuedosciencemodern advocates of homeopathy chiropracty and traditionachinese medicine receive little respect because for the mospart they use methods and reasoning that the kind of researclee lady recommends has shown to be terribly faulty this doenot imply that all their treatments are ineffective it doesimply that those who rely on faulty methodology and reasoning arincapable of discovering which treatments are effective anwhich are notfirst of all i think you are arguing against a straw man because dont think that anyone here is arguing that quackery pseudosciencehomeopathy chiropracty and traditional chinese medicine should baccepted as science i in particular think the basic ideas ohomeopathy and chiropracty seem extremely flaky what some of us do believe however is that some of these thingincluding some of the flaky ideas are deserving of serious scientifiattention if in fact it were true as you have stated above that those who do nouse the currently fashionable methodology can have no idea what ieffective and what is not then science today would not exist for alof current science is based on the past work of scientists whosmethodology by current standards was seriously flawed it is certainly true that as methodology improves we need to reexaminthose results derived in the past using less perfect methodologies it ialso true that the results obtained by people today who still rely onthose early methodologies needs to be reexamined in a more rigorousfashion by those qualified to do so credibly but to say that nobody who fails to do elaborate doubleblind studies icapable of knowing their ass from a hole in the ground and to say that nideas that come from outside the scientific establishment could possiblbe worthy of serious investigation this truly marks ones attitude adoctrinaire cultist this attitude is not compatible with a belief ireason in the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists psychology seemsless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects ladyuhunixuhcchawaiiedu ladyuhunixbitne
