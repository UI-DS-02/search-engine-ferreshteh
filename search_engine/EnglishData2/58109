i noticed several years ago that when i took analgesics fairly regularlymotrin at the time i seemed to get a lot of migraines but haforgotten about that until i started reading some of the posts herei generally dont take nsaids or tylenol for headaches because ivfound them to be ineffective however i have two other pain sourcethat force me to take nsaids currently naprosyn first is sompelvic pain that i get at the beginning of my period and then mucworse at midcycle i have had surgery for endometriosis in the pas12 years ago so the drs tell me that my pain is probably duto the endometriosis coming back ive tried synarel it reducethe pain while i took it 3 mos but the pain returned immediatelafter i stopped three doctors have suggested hysterectomy as thonly real solution to my problem although i dont expect to havany more children i dont like the idea of having my uterus anone remaining ovary removed the first ovary was removed when i hathe surgery for endometriosis one of the drs that suggestei get a hysterectomy is an expert in laser surgery but perhaps thinkthat type of procedure is only worthwhile on women who still plato have children so basically all im left with is toughing outhe pain this would be impossible without naprosyn or somethinsimilar but not aspirin that doesnt work and motrin gave mhorrible gastritis a few years ago so im through with it ifact naprosyn works very well at eliminating the pain if i takit regularly as i did when i had severe back pain and pain in bothlegs as ill discuss in a moment generally though i wait untii have the pain before i take the naprosyn but then it takeseveral hours for it reduce the pain its actually quite effectivat reducing the pain it just takes quite a while in the meantimim frequently in severe painthe other pain source i have is chronic lower back pain resulting ibilateral radiculopathy ive had mris xrays ct scan and emgive had 2 of them and dont intend to ever do that again witnerve conduction tests the tests have not been conclusive as twhat is causing my back and leg pain the mri reports both say i havseveral bulging degeneratig disks and from the xrays and mri i thinkit is apparent that i have arthritis the reading on the ct scawas that there are two herniations l3l4 and l4l5 but otherhav looked at the films and concluded that there are no herniationsthe second emg and nerve conduction studies shows significant denervatiocompared to the first emg oh yeah i had some other horrible testcalled something like somatic evoked response which showed that thinternal nerves are working fine anyway the bottom line is thai sometimes have severe pain in both legs and back pain the back paiis there all the time but i can live with it when the leg pain is therei need some analgesicantiinflammatory medication to reduce the paito a level where i can work so i took naprosyn regulary for 6months every time i tried to stop the leg pain got worse so idalways resume since last november i have taken it much less frequentlyand primarily for the pelvic pain i have been going to physicatherapy for the last 8 months 23 times a week after the first montor so my therapist put me on pelvic traction she had tried it earlierbut it had caused a lot of pain in my back this time she tried it aa lower weight after a month or two the pain in my legs began goinaway but the traction aways caused discomfort in my lower back whiccould be reduced with ultrasound and massage so now i dont havnearly as much pain in my legs in fact my therapist took me oftraction about 2 weeks agogetting back to my original reason for this post even if i can avoitaking analgesic for headaches i really cant avoid them entirely becausi have other pain sources that force me to use them oh i forgoto mention that it has been suggested to me that i have back surgerybut im avoiding that too i find the migraines difficult to deal withoccassionally i have to take off work but usually i can work but aa reduced capacity im a systems engineer and do a lot of readinand writing when the pelvic pain is bad i cant concentrate muchi usually end up jumping out of my chair every few minutes becausthe pain is so bothersome when the pain in my back is bad it cacause severe burning in both legs shooting pains in my legs electrishock type of pain in my feet and toes and basically when it gets bai cant really sit at all then i end up spending most of my time homand in bed so even if the analgesics contribute to the migraines thmigraines are more tolerable than the other pain sources i get a loof migraines an average of 3 to 4 a month which last 13 daysive taken cafergot the first time the caffiene really got to me si reduced the dosage but i dont like the side effects if i takmore than two i get diahrea if i get a very bad headache i wileventually take the cafergot my neurologist wasnt very helpful whei told him my problems with cafergot he said that when sumatriptabecomes available i should try that ive tried several other medicationfiornal midrin fiornal with codeine tegretol and inderal buthey either didnt work or i couldnt tolerate them so what can i domy doctors seem to be satisfied with me just trying to tolerate thpain which i agree with most of the time but not when i have a lot opain ive had some bad experiences with surgery my heart stoppeonce from the anesthesia i was told that it was likely thsuccinylcholine and ive already had surgery several timesanyway the point of what im saying is that even if analgesics can contributto migraines some people need to take them to tolerate other painjanice rathman
