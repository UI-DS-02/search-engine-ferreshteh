msnyder nmt edu rebecca snyder writes does anyone know how posionous centipedes and millipedes are if someon was bitten how soon would medical treatment be needed and what woul be liable to happen to the person just for clarification i have not been bitten by one of these but m house seems to be infested and i want to know just in case rebecc tmillipedes i understand are vegetarian and therefore almos certainly will not bite and are not poisonous centipedes ar carnivorous and although i don t have any absolute knowledge on this would tend to think that you re in no danger from anything but concerted assault by several million of them t t tgnot sure of this but i think some millipedes cause a toxic reaction stingso i would not assume that they are not dangerous merely on the basis ofvegetarianism after all wasps are vegetarian toodnc
