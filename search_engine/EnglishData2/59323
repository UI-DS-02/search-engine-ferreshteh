this question came up in sci med nutrition and im posting my answerhere only 22 medical schools in the us teach courses on humannutrition we have already seen what a lack of nutrition education can dowhen candida and kidney stones present themselves to the medical communityi think that the best example of where us medicine is really missing themark when it comes to a knowledge of nutrition is pms so many womenandtheir husbands suffer from this disorder that it is really criminal thatmost physicians in the us are not taught that pms is primarily caused bydiet and diet changes can prevent it from ever happpening before shootingyour flames read the entire article and then decide if flaming isjustifiedfrom a poster in sci medi nutrition tin a psychological anthropology course i am taking we got sidetracked onto a short conversation about pms some rumors share by several of the students included ideas that vitamin levels suga intake and caffeine intake might affect pms symptoms tis there any data on this or is it just so much hooey many thanks michael ive wanted to reply to this post ever since i saw it but i gotsidetracked with candida pms is a lot like candida blooms mostphysicians

during pmsthere are numerous observational studies that have been published in themedical literature which also suggest that pms is primarily a disorderthat arises out of a hormone imbalance that is dietary in nature butsince observational studies are considered by most physicians in sci medto be anecdotal in nature i have not bothered to cite them there arealso over a half dozen good experimental studies that have been done onmultivitamin and mineral supplementation to prevent pms ive chosen thebest specific studies on individual vitamins and minerals to try to point outthat pms is primarily a nutritional disorder but doctors dont recognizenutritional disorders unless they can see clinical pathologyberiberipellagra scruvy etc pms is probably the best reason why every doctorbeing trained in the us should get a good course on human nutrition pmsis really only the tip if the iceberg when it comes to nutritionaldisorders its time that medicine woke up and smelled the
