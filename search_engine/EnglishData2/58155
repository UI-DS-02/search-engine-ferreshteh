my biggest resentment is the doctor who makes it seem like mos people with dizziness can be cured that s definitely not th case in most cases like i said above it is a long tediou process that may or may not end up in a partial cure be sure to say chronic dizziness not just dizziness mos patients with acute or subacute dizziness will get better the vertiginous spells of meniere s will also eventually g away however the patient is left with a deaf earall true and all good points to anyone suffering with vertigo dizziness or any variatio thereof my best advice to you as a fellow sufferer is this just keep searching don t let the doctors tell you there nothing that can be done do your own research and let you this may have helped you but i m not sure it is good genera advice the odds that you are going to find some miracle wit your own research that is secret or hidden from general knowledg for this or any other disease are slim when good answers to thes then spending a great deal of time and energy on the medica problem may divert that energy from more productive thing in life a limited amount should be spent to assure yoursel that your doctor gave you the correct story but after it become clear that you are dealing with a problem for which medicin has no good solution perhaps the best strategy is to joi the support group and keep abreast of new findings but not t make a career out of itwell making a career out of it is a bit strong i still believthat doing your own research is very very necessary i woulnot have progressed as much as i have today unless i had spenthe many hours in stanford s med library as i have doneand 5 years ago it was clear that there was no medicine thatwould help me so should i have stopped searching thangoodness i didn t now i found that there is indeed medicinthat helps me i think that what you ve said is kind of idealistic that yowould go to one doctor get a diagnosis maybe get a seconopinion and then move on with your lifejust as an example having seen 6 of the top specialists inthis field in the country i have received 6 different diagnosesthese are the top names the ones that people come to from all ovethe country i have had to sort all of this out myself gointo a support group and in fact heading that support group washelpful for a while but after a point i found it verunproductive it was much more productive to do library researchmake phone calls and put together the pieces of the puzzle myselfa recent movie lorenzo s oil offers a perfect example of whai m talking about if you haven t seen it you should it s noa put down of doctor s and neither is what i m saying doctors aronly human and can only do so much but there are those of uout here who are intelligent and able to sometimes find a missinpiece of the puzzle that might have otherwise gone unnoticedi guess i m biased because dizziness is one of those weird thingthat is still so unknown if i had a broken arm or a weak heartor failing kidneys i might not have the same opinion that s becausethose things are much more tangible and have much more concisedefinitions and treatments with dizziness you just have tdecide to live with it or decide to live with it while trying tfind your way out of iti have chosen the latterlindlindae netcom netcom co gordon banks n3jxp skepticism is the chastity of the intellect an geb cadre dsl pitt edu it is shameful to surrender it too soon
