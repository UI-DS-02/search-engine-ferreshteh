banschbachvmsocomokstateedu writesare in a different class the big question seems to be is it reasonable touse them in patients with gi distress or sinus problems that could be dueto candida blooms following the use of broadspectrum antibiotics i guess im still not clear on what the term candida bloom means but certainly it is well known that thrush superficial candida infections on mucous membranes can occur after antibiotic use this has nothing to do with systemic yeast syndrome the quack diagnosis that has been being discussedfound in the sinus mucus membranes than is candida women have been knownfor a very long time to suffer from candida blooms in the vagina and awomen is lucky to find a physician who is willing to treat the cause andnot give give her advise to use the otc antifungal creams lucky how since a recent article randomized controlled trial o oral yogurt on reducing vaginal candidiasis ive mentioned to a number of patients with frequent vaginal yeast infections that the could try eating 6 ounces of yogurt daily it turns out most woul rather just use antifungal creams when they get yeast infectionsyogurt dangerous if this were a standard part of medical practice asgordon r says it is then the incidence of gi distress and vaginal yeastinfections should decline again this just isnt what the systemic yeast syndrome is about an has nothing to do with the quack therapies that were being discussed there is some evidence that attempts to reinoculate the gi tract wit bacteria after antibiotic therapy dont seem to be very helpful i reducing diarrhea but i dont think anyone would view this as quack therapy david rinyogurt contains lactobacillus acidophilus and l bulgaricus lacidophilus is the major bacteria in the vaginal tract and is primarilyresponsible for keeping the vaginal tract acidic and yeast free most ofthe commercial yogurt sold in the us has a very low l acidophilus and lbulgaricus count neither of these bacteria are obligate anaerobes with aremuch more important in dealing with the diarrhea problem gordon r has toldme through email that he gives his patients l acidophilus and severaldifferent obligate anaerobeswhich setup shop in the colon but he hasnttold me which ones yet the lactobacillus genera are mostly facultativeanaerobes and will setup shop where they have access to oxygen if given achancemouth anus sinus cavity and vagina having these good bacteriaaround will greatly decrease the chance of candida blooms in the analregion or the vagina i have not proposed a systemic action for candidablooms i know that others swear that all kinds of symptoms arise fromthe evil yeast blooms in the body im not ready to buy that yet i dobelieve that complications at specific sitesvagina anal and maybe lowercolon sinus and mouth can result from antibiotic use which removes thecompeting bacteria from these sites and thus lets candida grow uncheckedrestoring the right bacterial balance is the best wayin my opinion to getrid of the problem antifungals a low carbohydrate diet and vitamin asupplementation may all help to minimize the local irritation until thegood bacteria can take over control of the food supply again and lower theph to basically starve the candida outmarty b
