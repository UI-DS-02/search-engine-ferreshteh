2 science has not historically progressed in any sort of rationa experiment data theory sequence most experiments are carried out an interpreted in pre existing theoretical frameworks the theoretica controversies of the day determine which experiments get done overall there is a huge messy affair of personal jealousies crazy motivations petty hatreds and the like that determines which experiments and whic computations get done what keeps it going forward is the critica function of science results don t count unless they can be replicated the whole system is a sort of mechanism for generate and test the generat part can be totally irrational as long as the test part works properlyi think we agree on much however the paragraphs above seem to repeauncritically the standard kuhn lakatos feyerabend view of progress an rationality in science since i ve addressed these issues in thinewsgroup in the not too distant past i won t go into them again nowwhat is wrong with the above observation is that it explicitly gives thimpression and you may not in fact hold this view that the common perhapeven the correct approach for a scientist to follow is to sit arounhaving flights of fancy and scheming on the basis of his jealousies anpetty hatreds it further at least implicitly advances the position thasciences goes forward and it is not clear what this means given thcontext in which it occurs by generating in a completely non rationaand even random way a plethora of hypotheses and theories that are theweeded out via the critical function of science though why this criticafunction should be less subject to the non rational forces is a mysteryif experimental design hypotheses creation and theory construction arsubject to jealousies and petty hatreds then this must be equally truof the application of any critical function concerning replicationthis is what leads one ala feyerabend to an anything goes view true the generation part can be totally irrational but typically it i not anecdotes concerning instances where a hypothesis seems to havresulted in some way from a dream or from one s political views simpldo not generalize well to the actual history of science gary h merrill principal systems developer c compiler developmentsas institute inc sas campus dr cary nc 27513 919 677 800sasghm theseus unx sas com mcnc sas sasgh
