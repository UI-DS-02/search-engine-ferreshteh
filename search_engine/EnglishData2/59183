great post martin very informative wellbalanced and humanitariawithout neglecting the need for scientific rigorcrossposted to altpsychologypersonality since some personality typinwill be discussed at the beginning note ive set all followups to scimesince most of my comments are more scimed oriented and im sure most of threplies if any will be medrelatedi can not believe the way this thread on candidayeast has progressedsteve dyer and i have been exchanging words over the same topic in scimed nutrition when he displayed his typical reserve and attacked a womanposter for being treated by a licenced physician for a disease that didnot exist calling this physician a quack was reprehensible steve and isee that you and some of the others are doing it here as well they are just responding in their natural way hypercholeric syndrome hcsoops that is not a recognized illness in the psychological communitybetter not say that since it therefore must not and never will exist actually it is fascinating that a disproportionate number of physicianwill type out as nt for those not familiar with the myersbriggs systemjust email me and ill send a summary file to you in the generapopulation nts comprise only about 12 of the population but amonphysicians it is much much higher i dont know the exact percentage any help here appersone driving characteristic of an nt especially an ntj is their obvioucholeric behavior driver type a etc the extreme emotional need tcontrol to lead andor to be the best or the most competent if they aralso extroverted they are best described as field marshalls this traiis very valuable and essential in our society we need people who want tlead to strive to overcome the elements to seek and thirst for knowledgeto raise the level of competency etc the great successes in science antechnology are in large part due to the vision an n trait and scientificallyminded approach t trait of the nt personality of course the other typeand temperaments have their own positive contributions as well howeverwhen the nt person has selfimage challenges the darkside of thipersonality type usually comes out which should be obvious to alla physician who is a strong nt and who has not learned to temper theitemperament will be extremely businesslike lack of empathy or feelingand is very compelled to have total control over their patient the patienmust be obedient to their diagnosis and prescription without question ivknown many mds of this temperament and suffice to say i dont oblige thewith a followup visit no matter how competent i think they are and theusually are very competent from a knowledge viewpoint since that is aextreme drive of theirs to know the most to know it allmaybe we need more nf doctors enough on this subject lets move on to candida bloomlet me tell you who the quacks really are these are the physicans who haveno idea how the human body interacts with its environment and how thatbalance can be altered by diet and antibiotics could it just bprofessional jealousy i couldnt help elaine or jon but somebody else didyouve helped me already by your post of course i believe that i havbeen misdiagnosed on the net as suffering from anal retentivitis but beinthe phlegmatic i am maybe i was just a little too harsh on a few peoplmyself in past posts lets all try to raise the level of this discussioabove the level of anal effluenthumans have allkinds of different organisms living in the gi system mouth stomach smalland large intestine sinuses vagina and on the skin these arenonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immunesystem is compromised they are also called nonpathogens because unlikethe pathogenic organisms that cause human disease they do not producetoxins as they live out their merry existence in and on our body but any ofthese organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take upresidence within the body a poor mucus membrane barrier can let thishappen and vitamin a is mainly responsible for setting up this barrierin my welldescribed situation in prior posts i definitely was immunstressed blood tests showed my vitamin a levels were very low my sinusewere a mess no doubt the mucosal lining and the cilia were heavily damagedi also was on antibiotics 15 times in 4 years in the end even two weekof ceftin did not work and i had confirmed diagnoses of a chronic bacteriainfection of the sinuses via catscans mucus color wont get into thdetails and other symptoms three very traditional ents made thidiagnosis i did not have any cultures done however because of thdifficulty of doing this right and because my other symptoms clearly showea bacterial infection enough of this background provided to help younderstand where i was when i make comments about my sporanox antifungatherapy belowthe first question i have is this can fungus penetrate a little way into poomucus membrane tissue maybe via hyphae thus causing symptoms without beinconsidered systemic in the classic sense it is sort of an inbetweeinfectionsteve got real upset with elaines doctor because he was using antifungalsand vitamin a for her gi problems if steve really understoood whatvitamin a does in the body he would notor at least should not be callingelaines doctor a quacki was concerned too because of the toxicity of vitamin a my doctor aftemy blood tests put me on 75000 iu of vitamin a for one week only thedropped it down to 25000 iu for the next couple of weeks i also receivezinc and other supplementation since all of these interrelate in fairlcomplex ways as my doctor explained hes one of those evil orthomoleculaspecialists i had a blood test three weeks later and vitamin a was normalhe then stopped me on all vitamin a except for some in a multivitaminsupplement and made sure that i maintain a 50000 iuday of beta carotenecall me carrot face hopefully elaines doctor will take a similar careful approach and tall supplements im even reevaluating some supplements im taking foexample niacin in fairly large dosages 1 gramday which steve dyer hagood information about on scimednutrition if niacin only has secondordeimprovement in symptomatic relief of my sinus allergies then it probably inot worth taking such a large dose longterm and risking liver damagesurvives if it gets access to a lot of glucose it blooms and over ridesthe other organisms living with it in the sinuses gi tract or vagina inthough i do now believe based on my successful therapy with sporanox thai definitely had some excessive growth of fungus unknown species in msinuses i still want to ask the question have there been any studies thademonstrate candida blooms in the sinuses with associated sinus irritatiosinusitisrhinitis my sinus irritation reduced significantly after onweek of sporanox and no other new treatments were implemented during thitime i did not have any noticeable gi track problems before starting osporanox but some for a few days after which then went away considerenormalbtw my doctor dug out one of his medical reference books sorry canremember which one and found an obscure comment dating back into the 1950which stated that people can develop contained nonlethal or nonseriousaspergillis infestations aspergiliosis of the sinuses leading to sinuinflammation symptoms ill have to dig out that reference again since iis relevant to this discussionsome people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucusmembrane or skin bloom site whether this is an allergic like reaction tothe candida or not isnt certainmy doctor tested me i believe a rast or rast similar test for allergiresponse to specificially candida albicans and i showed a strong positiveanother question would everybody show the same strong positive so this tesis essentially useless and assuming it is true that candida can gropartway into the mucus membrane tissue and the concentration exceeds athreshold amount could not a person who tests as having an allergy tcandida definitely develop allergic symptoms such as mucus membranirritation due to the bodys allergic response as i said in an earlier postone does not need to be a rocket scientist or have a md degree or aphd in biochemistry to see the plausibility of this hypothesisbtw and ill repost this again dr ivker in his book sinus survivalhas routinely given before anything else nizoral a presporanox systemiantifungal not as safe and not as good as sporanox to his new chronisinusitis patients if they have been on antibiotics four or more times ithe last two years he claims that out of 2000 or so patients well ove90 notice some relief of sinus inflammation and other symptoms but idoesnt cure it by any means implying the socalled yeastfungus infectiois not the primary cause but a later complication hes also found thanystatin whether taken internally or put into a sinus spray does not helpthis implies of course assuming that excessive yeastfungus bloom iaggravating the sinus inflammation that the yeastfungus has grown partwainto the tissue since nystatin will not kill yeastfungus other than bdirect contact it is not absorbed into the blood stream again i admitlots of ifs and implies which doesnt please the hardcore nt whhas to have the doubleblind study or its a nonissue but one has to starwith some plausible hypothesisexplanation a strawman if you willif its internal only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are prettynondescript this brings up an interesting observation used by those who will denand reject any and all aspects of the yeast hypothesis until thappropriate studies are done and that is if you cant observe or culturthe yeast bloom in the gut or sinus then theres no way to diagnose oeven recognize the disease and i know they realize that it is virtuallimpossible to test for candida overbloom in any part of the body that cannobe easily observed since candida is everywhere in the bodyits a real catch22another catch22 those who totally reject the yeast hypothesis say thano studies have been done actually studies have been done but if its noup to a certain standard then it is from their perspective a nonstudy whicshould not even be considered i agree that the appropriate studies shoulbe done and that will take big to do it right however in order tconvince the funding agencies in these austere times to open their walletsyou literally have to give them evidence and the only acceptable evidence tcompete with other proposals is paradoxically to do almost the exact studneeded funding that is you have to do 90 of the study before you even gefunding as a scientist at a national lab im very aware of this for thsmaller funded projects im afraid that even if dr ivker and 100 othedoctors got together pooled their practices case histories and anecdoteinto a compelling picture and approach the funding agencies they would genowhere even if they were able to publish their statistical resultsit is obvious from the comments by some of the doctors here is that they havdecided excessive yeast colonization in the gut or sinuses leading tnoticeable nonlethal symptoms does not exist and is not even a tenablhypothesis so any amount of case histories or compiled anecdotal evidencto the contrary will never change their mind and not only that they woulalso oppose the needed studies because in their minds its a done issue excessive yeast growth leading to diffuse allergic symptoms does not wilnot and cannot exist period kind of tough to dialog with those who holsuch a viewpoint kind of reminds me of listercandida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora inthe sinuses the gi tractmouth stomach and intestines and in thevaginal tract which compete with it for food the human immune systemususally does not bother itself with thesenonpathogenic organisms unlessthey broach the mucus membrane barrier if they do an inflammatoryresponse will be set up most americans are not getting enough vitamin afrom their diets about 30 of all americans die with less vitamin a thanthey were born withus autopsy studies while this low level of vitamina does not cause pathologyblindness it does impair the mucus membranebarrier system this would then be a predisposing factor for a stronginflammatory response after a candida bloom arent there also other nutrients necessary to the proper working of thsinus mucus membranes and ciliawhile diabetics can suffer from a candida bloom the most common cause ofthis type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics whichknock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the maincompetition for candida as far as food is concerned while drugs areavailable to handle candida many patients find that their doctor will notuse them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection the toxicity ofthe antifungal drugs does warrant some caution but if the gi or sinusinflammation is suspected to be candidaand recent use of a broad spectrumantibiotic is the smoking gun then antifungal use should be approrpriatejust as the antifungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurringvaginal yeast infections in spite of what mr steve dyer saysagain the evidence from mycological studies indicate that many yeastfunguspecies can grow hyphae roots into deep tissue similar to mold growinin bread you can continue to kill the surface such as nystatin does buyou cant kill that which is deeper in the tissue without using a systemiantifungal such as itraconazole sporanox or some of the older ones sucas nizoral which are more toxic and not as effective this is why as habeen pointed out by recent studies sent to me by a doctor ive been iemail contact with thanks that nystatin is not effective in the longterm treatment of gi tract candidiasis its like trying to weed a gardeby cutting off whats above the ground but leaving the roots ready to comout again once you walk awaythe 60000 question is whether a contained candida bloom can partiallgrow into tissue through the mucus membranes causing some types of symptomin susceptible people eg allergy without becoming systemic in thclassical sense of the word something in between strictly an excessivbloom not causing any problems and the fullblown systemic infection thais potentially lethalin the gi system the anorectal region seems to be a particularly goodreservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a veryfavorable environment around the rectum for transferthrough moisture andhumidity of candida to the vaginal tract one of the most effctive ways tominimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear also if one is an anal retentive like ive been diagnosed in a priopost that can also provide more sites for excessive candida growth if the bloom occurs in the anal area the burning swelling pain and evenblood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids if thebloom manages to move further up the gi tract very diffuse symptomatologyoccursabdominal discomfort and blood in the stool this positive stoolfor occult blood is what sent elaine to her family doctor in the firstplace after extensive testing he told her that there was nothing wrongbut her gut still hurt on to another doctor and so on richard kaplanhas told me throiugh email that he considers occult blood tests in stoolspecimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number offalse positivescandida blooms guys if my gut hurt me on a constantbasis i would want it fixed yes its nice to know that i dont havecolon cancer but what then is causing my distress when i finally find adoctor who treats me and gets me 90 better steve dyer calls him a quackas ive said in private email there are flaws in our current medical systethat make it difficult or even impossible for a physician to attempalternative therapies after the approvedprovenaccepted therapies dont workfor example i went to three ents who all said that i will just have to livwith my acutechronic sinusitis after the abs failed they did mentiosurgery to open up the ostia but my ostia werent plugged and it would noget to the root cause of my condition after three months of aggressive anfairly nonstandard therapy sporanox body nutrient level monitoring anequalization vitamin c lentinen echinacea etc my health has vastlimproved to where i was two years ago before my health greatly deterioratedof course skeptics would say that maybe if i did nothing i would havimproved anyway but that view is stretching things quite far because of thexperience of the three ents i saw who said that id just have to live witit im confident i will reach what one could call a total cure thantifungal program i undertook was one necessary step in that directiobecause of my overuse of abs for the last four years note for thoshaving sinus problems may i suggest the book by dr ivker i mention abovebe sure to get the revised editioni have often wondered what an md with chronicgi distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells hispatients is a nonexistent syndromedr ivker started off having chronic and severe sinus problems and hivisits to several ents totally floored him when they said youll just havto live with it he spent several years trying everything standard annonstandard until he was essentially cured of chronic sinusitis he noshares his approach in his book and i can honestly say that i am on the roato recovery following some parts of it his one recommendation to take systemic antifungal at the beginning of treatment if you have a history oantibiotic overuse has been proven to him time and time again in his owpractice im sure if i commented to him of the hardcore beliefs of the antiyeast hypothesis posters that he would have definite things to say such asits worked wonders for me in almost two thousand cases to put it mildlyi also would not be surprised if he would say that they are the ones violatintheir moral obligations to help the patientmaybe those doctors who are reading this who have a practice and arconfronted by a patient having symptoms that could be due to the hypotheticayeast overgrowth eg they fit some of the profiles the proyeast peoplhave identified should consider antifungal therapy if all other avenuehave been exhausted remember theory and practice are two different things you cannot have one without the other they are synergistic if a doctor doesomething nonstandard yet produces noticeable symptomatic relief in over thousand of his patients shouldnt you at least sit up and take noticemaybe you ought to trust what he says and begin hypothesizing why it workinstead of why it shouldnt work im afraid a lot of doctors have becomso enamored with scientific correctness that they are ignoring the patientthey have sworn to help you have to do both both have to be balanced whicwe dont see from some of the posters to this group there comes a point wheyou just have to use a little common sense and maybe an empirical approacsuch as trying a good systemic antifungal such as sporanox after havinexhausted all the other avenues i was one of those who the traditionamedical establishment was not able to help so i did the natural thing went to a couple of doctors who are somewhat outside this establishmentand as a result i have found significant reliefwould it not be better if the traditional medical establishment can set usome kind of mechanism where any doctor without fear of being sued or havinhis license pulled can try experimental and unproven beyond a doubttherapies for hisher patients that finally reach the point where all thaccepted therapies are ineffective id like to hear a doctor tell mewell ive tried all the therapies that are approved and accepted in thicountry and since they clearly dont work for you i now have the authoritto use experimental unproven techniques that seem to have helped others cant promise anything and there are some risks you will have to sigsomething saying you understand the experimental and possibly risky nature othese unproven therapies and ill have to register your case at the statboard anyway if my ent had suggested this to me i wouldve jumped on thipronto instead of going to one of those doctors who for either altruistireasons or for greed is practicing these alternative therapies with mucrisk to himher risk meaning losing their license and possibly to thpatient such a mechanism would keep control in the more mainstream medicineand also provide valuable data that would essentially be free it also woulbe morally and ethically better than the current system by showing thcompassion of the medical community to the patient that its doing everythinit can within reason to help the patient it is the lack of such a mechanisthat is leading large numbers of people to try alternative therapies some owhich seem to work like my case and others of which will never work at altrue quackeryi better get off my soapbox before this post reaches 500k in sizeif taken orally it can also become a major bacteria in the gut througharesol sprays it has also been used to innoculate the sinus membranesbut before this innoculation occurs the mucus membrane barrier systemneeds to be strengthened this is accomplished by vitamin a vitamin c andsome of the bcomplex vitamins diet surveys repeatedly show that americansare not getting enough b6 and folate these are probably the segement ofthe population that will have the greatest problem with this nonexistentdisordercandida blooms after antibiotic therapywhat dosage of b6 appears to be necessary to promote the healing and propeworking of the mucos memebranessome of the above material was obtained from natural healing by markbricklin published by rodale press as well as notes from my humannutrition course i will be posting a discussion of vitamin a sometime inthe future along with reference citings to point out the extremelyimportant role that vitamin a plays in the mucus membrane defense system inthe body and why vitamin a should be effective in dealing with candidablooms another effective dietary treatment is to restrict carbohydrateintake during the treatment phase this is especially important if the gisystem is involved if candida can not get glucose its not going to outgrow the bacteria and you then give bacteria which can use amino acids andfatty acids for energy a chance to take over and keep the candida in checkonce carbohydrate is returned to the gutid like to see the role of complex carbohydrates such as starchif steve and some of the other naysayers want to jump all over this postfine i jumped all over steve in sci med nutrition because he verbablyaccosted a poster who was seeking advice about her doctors use of vitamina and antifungals for a candida bloom in her gut people seeking advicefrom newsnet should not be treated this way those of us giving of ourtime and knowledge can slug it out to our hearts content if you savedyour venom for me steve and left the helpless posters who are timidlyseeking help alone i wouldnt have a problem with your behaviorbrave soul you are the venom on usenet can be quite toxic unless ondevelops an immunity to it one year ago my phlegmatic self would havbacked down right away from an attack of cholericitis but my immunsystem and my computer system have been hardened from graduadesensitization i now kind of like being called anal retentive it haa nice ring to it i also was very impressed by
