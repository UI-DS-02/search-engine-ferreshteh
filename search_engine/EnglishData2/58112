i may not be the world s greatest expert on chiggers a type omite indigenous to the south but i certainly have spent a loof time contemplating the little buggers over the past six year since we moved to n c here are some observations gained fropainful experience 1 reactions to chiggers vary greatly from person to person some people get tiny red bites others like me are mor sensitive and get fairly large swollen sore like affairs 2 chigger bites are the gift that keeps on giving i swea that these things will itch for months 3 there is a lot of folklore about chiggers i think most o it is fiction i have tried to do research on the critters since they have such an effect on me the only book i coul find on the subject was a single book in unc s specia collections library i have not yet gone through what i required to get it 4 based on my experience and that of my family members the ol folk remedy of fingernail polish simply doesn t work i recal reading that the theory upon which it is based that the chigger burrow into your skin and continue to party there is false think it is more likely that the reaction is to toxins of som sort the little pests release but this is speculation 5 the best approach is prevention a couple of things work well a good insect repellent deet such as deep woods off liberall applied to ankles waistband etc is a good start there i another preparation called chig away that is a combination o sulfur and some kind of cream cortisone that originally wa prepared for the army and is not commercially available i the summer i put this on my ankles every morning when i ge up on weekends since i literally can t go outside where w live in the country without serious consequences the apparently don t like sulfur much at all you can use sulfu as a dust on your body or clothing to repel them 6 no amount of prevention will be completely successful forge the fingernail polish i have finally settled upon a treatmen that involves topical application of a combination of cortison creme reduces the inflamation and swelling and benzocain relieves the itch i won t tell you all the things i ve tried nor will i tell you some of the things my wife does since thi counts as minor surgery and is best not mentioned i also thin it gains nothing 7 the swelling and itching can also be significantly relieve by the application of hot packs and this seems to speed recover as welldoctors seem not to care much about chiggers the urban and suburbadoctors apparently don t encounter them much and the rural doctorseem to regard them as a force of nature that one must endure suspect that anyone who could come up with a good treatment for chiggerwould make a lot of money gary h merrill principal systems developer c compiler developmentsas institute inc sas campus dr cary nc 27513 919 677 800sasghm theseus unx sas com mcnc sas sasgh
