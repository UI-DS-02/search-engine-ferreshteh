robertim so glad that you posted your biological alchemy discussion ivebeen compared to the famous robert mcelwaine by some readers of sci medi didnt know how to respond since i had not seen one of your postsjustlike i havent read the yeast connectionlet me just start by stating that the authors of the cold fusion papers ofrecent years are now in scientific exilei believe that one has actuallyleft the country scientific fraud is rare im still not sure that if areview of the research notes of the cold fusion scientists actuallyproved fraud or just very shoddy experimentationyour sources do not seem to be research articles they are more like laytexts designed to pique human interest in a subject areajust like the foodcombining and life extension texts robert i try to keep an open mindbut some things i just cant buyone is taking sod orally to preventoxidative damage in the bodyyour experiment if conducted by readers of this news group would provethat you are rightmore ash after seed sprouting than before unless youuse a muffle furnance and obtain a very high temperatureabove 600 degreesi believe you will get organic residue in the ash even the residue incommercial incinerators contains organic residue i remember doing thiskind of experiment in my organic chemistry couurse in college but icouldnt find a temperature for mineral ash formation so im reallyguessing at 600 degrees f it may actually be much higher the point isthat no one in their home could ever get a high enough temperature toproduce only a mineral ash they also could not measure the minerals sothey could only weigh the ash and find out that you appear to be correctchemical reactions abound in our body in our atmosphere in our water andin our soil are these fusion reactions yes many of them do involvefusing oxygen nitrogen and sulfur to both organics and inorganics do wereally have the transformation of silicone to calcium if carbon is fused withsilicon not in my book robertsilicon is the most abundant mineral on our planet ive seen speculationthat man could have evolved to be a silicon based rather than a carbonbased lifeform i like reading science fiction as many people do but iknow enough about biochemistryand nutrition to be ablein most cases toseparate the fiction from the factsilicon may be one of the trace elements that turns out to be essential inhumans we have several grams of the stuff in our body whats it doingthere only the lord knows right now but i will tell you what i do knowabout silicon and why as you state it helps bone healingand it is notbecause silicon is transformed into calciumalmost all of the silicon in the human body is found in the connectivetissuecollagen and elastin there have been studies published which showthat the very high silicon content in elastin may be an important protectivefactor against atherosclerosisthe higher the silicon content in elastinthe more resistant the elastin is to a an agerelated loss of elasticitywhich may play a role in the increase in blood pressure that is often seen aspart of the ageing process in humansfor bone fracture healing the first step is a collagen matrix into whichcalcium and phosphate are pumped by osteoblasts a high level of siliconin the diet seems to speed up this matrix formation this first step in thebone healing process seems to be the hardest for some people to get goingelectriacl currents have been used in an attempt to get the matrix formingcells oriented in the right direction so that the matrix can be formed inthe gapor gaps between the ends of the broken bone a vitamin c deficiencby slowing collagen formation as well as causing the prodcution ofdefective collagen does slow down both bone and wound healing zinc is alsoanother big player in bone and wound healing and so is siliconin an undetermined role that most likely involes matrix formation and nottransformation of silicon to calcium for you to take this bone healingobservation and use it as proof that silicon is transformed intocalcium is an interesting little trickbut robert i have the same problem myself when i read the lay pressandyes even some scientific papers is the explanation reasonable withouta very good science knowledge base you and most readers of this news groupare flying blindyou have to take it on faith because you dont know anybetterif the explanation seems to make sense to me based on my knowledge baseim inclined to consider itthis usually means trying to find other sourcesthat come to the same conclusion if the idealike a candida bloom seemsto make sense to me i tend to pursue it as long as any advice that imgoing to give isnt going to really mess somebody up if this makes uskindred souls robert then i guess ill have to live with that labelfor the physicians who have decided to read my response to robertsinteresting post i hope that you saw the segment on the pediatricneurosurgeon last night on us tv i cant remember the network or hisnamelike many nights i was on my computer and my wife was watching tv inour den where i have my computer setup this neurosurgeon takes kids withbrain tumors that everyone else has given up on and he usesunconventionaltreatmentshis own words he says that he has a 70 success rate the onecase that i heard him discussing would normally use radiationconventionaltreatment he was going to go in and cut you guys complain about thecost of the antifungals what do you think the cost difference betweenradiation treatment and surgery is guysim going to ask you guys one more time why blast a physician who takes thechronic sinus suffererlike jon and the chronic gi suffererlike elaineand tries to help them using unconventional treatments treatments whichdo not result in deathlike those that the neurosurgeon uses is itbecause candida blooms are not lifethreatening while brain tumors arehow about quality of life guys may the candida demon never cross yoursinus cavity or gutif it does you may feel differently about the issuemarty b
