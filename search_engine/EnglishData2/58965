this reminds me of the last graham kerr cooking show i saw today h smoked meat on the stovetop in a big pot he used a strange techniqu i d never seen before he took a big pot with lid and placed a tray in it made from aluminum foil the tray was about the size and shape of a typical coffee table ash tray made by crumpling a sheet of foil around the edges in the tray he placed a couple spoonfuls of brown sugar a simila quantity of brown rice he said any rice will do the contents of tw teabags of earl grey tea and a few cloves on top of this was placed an ordinary aluminum basket type steamer wit two chicken breasts in it the lid was put on and the whole assembl went on the stovetop at high heat for 10 or 12 minutes later he removed what looked like smoked chicken breasts what surprise and concerns me are 1 no wood chips where does the smoke flavor come from 2 about 5 or 10 years ago i remember hearing that carmel colo obtained by caramelizing sugar a common coloring and flavorin agent had been found to be carcinogenic i believe they injecte it under the skin of rats or something if the results were conclusive caramel color would not be legal in the u s yet it is still bein used was the initial research result found to be incorrect or what 3 about 5 or 10 years ago i remember earl grey tea being implicate as carcinogenic because it contains oil of bergamot an extrac from the skin of a type of citrus fruit does anyone know whateve happened with that story if it were carcinogenic earl grey te could not have it as an additive yet it apparently continues to d so wrt natural wood smoke i ve smoking a duck right now as it happens i ve noticed that a heavily smoked food item will have an unpleasant tang taste when eaten directly out of the smoker if the smoke has only recentl stopped flowing i find the best taste to be had by using dry wood chips getting lots of smoke right up at the beginning of the cooking process then slowly barbequing for hours and hours without adding additional wood chips my theory is that the unpleasant tangy molecules are low molecular weigh stuff like terpenes and that the smoky flavor molecules are some sor of larger molecule more similar to tar the long barbeque time afte the initial intensive smoke drives off the low molecular weight stuff just leaving the flavor behind does anyone know if my theory is correct i also remember hearing that the combustion products of fat drippin on the charcoal and burning are carcinogenic for that reason and becaus it covers the product with soot and some unpleasant tanginess i only gril non drippy meats like prawns directly over hot coals i do stuff like thi duck by indirect heat i have a long rectangular weber and i put the coal at one end and the meat at the other end the fat drops directly on th floor below the meat and next time i use the barbeque i make the fir in that end to burn off the fat and help ignite the coals and yet another reason i ve heard not to smoke or barbeque meat is tha smoked cured meat like pork sausage and bacon contain nitrosamines which are carcinogenic i m pretty sure this claim actuall has some standing don t know about the others an amusing incident i recall was the duncan hines scandal when it wa discovered that the people who make duncan hines cake mix were puttin a lot of ethylene dibromide edb into the cake mix to suppress weevils this is a fumigant which is known to be carcinogenic the guy who represented the company in the press conference defende himself by saying that the risk from eating duncan hines products every da for a year would be equal to the cancer risk from eating two charcoal broiled steaks what a great analogy when i first heard that m immediate reaction was we should make that a standard unit one charcoa broiled steak would be equivalent to 0 5 duncansi don t understand the assumption that because something is found tbe carcinogenic that it would not be legal in the u s i think thanaturally occuring substances excluding controlled substances arpretty much unregulated in terms of their use as food food additiveor other consumption it s only when the chemists concoct sp aingredient that it falls under fda regulations otherwise if theyreally looked closely they would find a reason to ban almost everythinghow in the world do you suppose it s legal to consume tobacco product which probably should be banned tdave alle tspace science engr ctr tuw madiso
