just had the opportunity to watch this flick on a e some 15 year since i saw it last wow the wwii channel did something not wwii i was very interested in the technology demonstrated in this fil for handling infectious diseases and similar toxic substances clearly they faked a lot of the computer robotic technology certainly at the time it was made most of that was science fictio itself let alone the idea of a space germ the graphics capabilities of the computers were very faked for movieaudiences who have not ability or patience with numbers the book was morerealistic in that respect in all respects actually the robotics arestill out of range but not impossible quite coincidentally actually this is what got me wanted to se the movie again i watched a segment on the otherwise awful how they do that dealing with a disease researcher at the cdc s to lab there was description of the elaborate security measures take so that building will never be cracked so to speak by man o nature short of deliberate bombing from the air perhaps an the researchers used spacesuits similar to that in the filmsf and i ve always wondered how crichton escapes this classification isusually ahead of science in both prediction and precaution nasa sdecontaimination processes were supposedly taken to prevent sf storydisasters i mean nasa scientists were often sf readers andsometimes writers and felt pre warned by their reading i m curious what people think about this film short of silly is such a facility technically feasible today i think the film still holds up among the best of sf films but that isn tsaying a whole lot as far as the plot and the crystalline structure that is not lif as we know it that s a whole nother argument for rec arts sf tec or somethingyep
