the mass of anectdotal evidence combined with the lack o a properly constructed scientific experiment disprovin the hypothesis makes the msg reaction hypothesis th most likely explanation for events the following is from a critique of a 60 minutes presentation on ms which was aired on november 3rd 1991 the critique comes from the tuft diet and nutrition letter february 1992 edited for brevity t chances are good that if you watched 60 minutes last novembe t3rd 1991 you came away feeling msg is bad for you i tthe segment entitled no msg for instance show host ed bradle tmakes alarming statements without adequately substantiating the t millions are suffering a host of symptoms and some get violentl tsick peppers his report with sensational but clinically unprove tpersonal testimony and speaks of studies on msg that make th tsubstance seem harmful without explaining just how inconclusive tthose studies are tconsider his making reference at the beginning of the program t ta study conducted at the eastern virginia medical school in orde tto back up his comment that there is a lot of evidence that msg ta flavor enhancer in chinese and other asian cuisines as well a tin many supermarket items causes headaches what he does no tmake reference to is the fact that the study was performed not o thumans but on rabbits tone of the researchers who conducted the study pharmacologis tpatricia williams ph d says it certainly is conceivable tha ta small minority of people are sensitive enough to msg to get theadaches from it but she explains the show probably toveremphasized the extent of the problem ta second lapse comes with mention of dr john olney a professo tat the washington university school of medicine who mr bradle tremarks says that his 20 years of research with laborator tanimals shows msg is a hazard for developing youngsters becaus tit poses a threat of irreversible brain damage dr olney tresearch with lab animals does not show anything about huma tyoungsters tin fact only under extreme circumsrtances did dr olney s texperiments ever bring about any brain damage when he injecte textremely high doses of msg into rodents completely bypassing ttheir digestive tracts and entering their bloodstreams more directly tand when he used tubes to force feed huge amounts of the substanc tto very young animals on an empty stomach of course neithe tof those procedures occurs with humans they simply take in msg twith food and most of what they take in is broken down b tenzymes in the wall of the small intestine so that very littl treaches the bloodstream much to little in fact for huma tblood levels of msg to come anywhere near the high concentration tfound in dr olney s lab animals tthe world health organization appears to be very much aware o tthat fact and so does the european communities scientifi tcommittee for food both after examining numerous studies thave concluded that msg is safe ttheir determination makes sense considering that msg has neve tbeen proven to cause all the symptoms that have been attribute tto it headaches swelling a tightness in the chest and tburning sensation among others in fact the most fail saf tof clinical studies the double blind study has consistentl texonerated the much maligned substance tthat s quite fortunate since the alleged hazardous component o tmonosodium glutamate glutamate enters our systems wheneve twe eat any food that contains protein the reason is that on tof the amino acids that make up protein glutamic acid is broke tdown into glutamate during digestion tit s a breakdown that occurs frequently glutamic acid is th tmost abundant of the 20 or so amino acids in the diet it make tup about 15 percent of the protein in flesh foods 20 percent i tmilk 25 percent in corn and 29 percent in whole wheat tthat doesn t mean it s entirely unimaginable that a small numbe tof people have trouble metabolizing msg properly and are therefor tsensitive to it the consensus reached by large internationa tprofessional organizations is that msg is safe the same consensu treached by the fda and the biomedical community at large rich young these are not kodak s opinions
