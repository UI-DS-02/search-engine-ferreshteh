this question came up in sci med nutrition and i m posting my answerhere only 22 medical schools in the u s teach courses on humannutrition we have already seen what a lack of nutrition education can dowhen candida and kidney stones present themselves to the medical communityi think that the best example of where u s medicine is really missing themark when it comes to a knowledge of nutrition is pms so many women andtheir husbands suffer from this disorder that it is really criminal thatmost physicians in the u s are not taught that pms is primarily caused bydiet and diet changes can prevent it from ever happpening before shootingyour flames read the entire article and then decide if flaming isjustifiedfrom a poster in sci medi nutrition tin a psychological anthropology course i am taking we got sidetracked onto a short conversation about pms some rumors share by several of the students included ideas that vitamin levels suga intake and caffeine intake might affect pms symptoms tis there any data on this or is it just so much hooey many thanks michael i ve wanted to reply to this post ever since i saw it but i gotside tracked with candida pms is a lot like candida blooms mostphysicians don t recognize it as a specific disease entity here iseverything that you would ever want to know about pmspremenstrual syndrome has been divided into four specific subgroups tpmt a

treat you for candida blooms while progesterone will work supplementation with vitamins and minerals works even better there reallyhas been an awful lot of research done on pms much more than candidablooms many of these studies have been what are called experimentalcontrolled studies the type of rigorous clinical studies that doctors like tosee done here are a few of these studies

supplementation was stopped pms symptoms tdid not reoccur in any of these 30 pts for upto one year after the tvitamin a supplementation was stoppedmost americans do not have a normal store of vitamin a in their liver these studies and several others were designed to see if getting a normalstore of vitamin a into the liver could eliminate pms of all the vitaminsgiven for pms vitamin a b6 and vitamin e vitamin a has shown the bestsingle effect this is probably because vitamin a is involved in steroid estrogen progesterone metabolism in the liver getting your liver fullof vitamin a seems to be one of the best things that you can do to preventthe symptoms of pms but vitamin a is toxic and you don t want to be tryingto do this without being seen by a physician who can monitor you for

menstrual distress questionnaire was significantly decreased by tmagnesium supplementation the authors suggest that magnesium tsupplemenation should become a routine treatment for the mood changes tthat occur during pmsthere are numerous observational studies that have been published in themedical literature which also suggest that pms is primarily a disorderthat arises out of a hormone imbalance that is dietary in nature butsince observational studies are considered by most physicians in sci med to be anecdotal in nature i have not bothered to cite them there arealso over a half dozen good experimental studies that have been done onmultivitamin and mineral supplementation to prevent pms i ve chosen thebest specific studies on individual vitamins and minerals to try to point outthat pms is primarily a nutritional disorder but doctors don t recognizenutritional disorders unless they can see clinical pathology beri beri pellagra scruvy etc pms is probably the best reason why every doctorbeing trained in the u s should get a good course on human nutrition pmsis really only the tip if the iceberg when it comes to nutritionaldisorders it s time that medicine woke up and
