thank you to all who gavei have been using wordscan plus for the past couple of weeks and would like toreview the product wordscan plus is a product of calera recognition systems it runs under windows 31 and supports that accufont technology of the hewlettpackard scanners when initially bringing up the software it lets you select several options1 text graphics 2 input source ie scanner fax file disk file 3automatic versus manual decomposition of the scanned imagei like manual decomposition since the software then lets me select whichparts of the document i would like scanned and in what orderonce an image is scanned you can bring up the popup image verification thesoftware gives you two errors at this point blue which are words that wereconverted reliability but do not match anything in the builtin dictionary yellow shade which are words that wordscan plus doesnt think it convertedcorrectly at all i have found that the software should give itself morecredit it is usually correct instead of wrong if a word is shaded blueyou can add it to your personal dictionary the only problem is the personaldictionary will only handle about 200 words i find this to be very limitedconsidering how many medical terms are not in a normal dictionaryafter a document is converted you can save it in a multitude of wordprocessor formats also any images that were captured can be

century that infectious diseases wouldsoon be eliminated as a public health problem 1 infectious diseases remainthe major cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of illness and death inthe united states since the early 1970s the us public health system hasbeen challenged by a myriad of newly identified pathogens and syndromes egescherichia coli o157h7 hepatitis c virus human immunodeficiency viruslegionnaires disease lyme disease and toxic shock syndrome the incidencesof many diseases widely presumed to be under control such as choleramalaria and tuberculosis tb have increased in many areas furthermorecontrol and prevention of infectious diseases are undermined by drugresistance in conditions such as gonorrhea malaria pneumococcal diseasesalmonellosis shigellosis tb and staphylococcal infections 2 emerginginfections place a disproportionate burden on immunocompromised persons thosein institutional settings eg hospitals and child day care centers andminority and underserved populations the substantial economic burden ofemerging infections on the us healthcare system could be reduced by moreeffective surveillance systems and targeted control and prevention programs3 this issue of mmwr introduces a new series emerging infectiousdiseases future articles will address these diseases as well assurveillance control and prevention efforts by healthcare

diseases cdceditorial note e coli o157h7 is a pathogenic gramnegative bacterium firstidentified as a cause of illness in 1982 during an outbreak of severe bloodydiarrhea traced to contaminated hamburgers 2 this pathogen has sinceemerged as an important cause of both bloody diarrhea and hus the most commoncause of acute renal failure in children outbreak investigations have linkedmost cases with the consumption of undercooked ground beef although otherfood vehicles including roast beef raw milk and apple cider also have beenimplicated 3 preliminary data from a cdc 2year nationwide multicenterstudy revealed that when stools were routinely cultured for e coli o157h7that organism was isolated more frequently than shigella in four of 10participating hospitals and was isolated from 78 of all bloody stools ahigher rate than for any other pathogen infection with e coli o157h7 often is not recognized because mostclinical laboratories do not routinely culture stools for this organism onhicnet medical newsletter page volume 6 number 10 april 20 199smac medium and many clinicians are unaware of the spectrum of illnessesassociated with infection 4 the usual clinical manifestations are diarrheaoften bloody and abdominal cramps fever is infrequent younger age groupsand the elderly are at highest risk for clinical manifestations andcomplications illness usually resolves after 68 days but 27 of patientsdevelop hus which is characterized by hemolytic anemia thrombocytopeniarenal failure and a death rate of 35 this report illustrates the difficulties in recognizing communityoutbreaks of e coli o157h7 in the absence of routine surveillance despitethe magnitude of this outbreak the problem may not have been recognized inthree states if the epidemiologic link had not been established in washington1 clinical laboratories should routinely culture stool specimens frompersons with bloody diarrhea or hus for e coli o157h7 using smac agar 5when infections with e coli o157h7 are identified they should be reportedto local health departments for further evaluation and if necessary publichealth action to prevent further cases e coli o157h7 lives in the intestines of healthy cattle and cancontaminate meat during slaughter cdc is collaborating with the usdepartment of agricultures food safety inspection service to identifycritical control points in processing as a component of a program to reducethe likelihood of pathogens such as e coli o157h7 entering the meat supplybecause slaughtering practices can result in contamination of raw meat withpathogens and because the process of grinding beef may transfer pathogensfrom the surface of the meat to the interior ground beef is likely to beinternally contaminated the optimal food protection practice is to cookground beef thoroughly until the interior is no longer pink and the juicesare clear in this outbreak undercooking of hamburger patties likely playedan important role the food and drug administration fda has issued interimrecommendations to increase the internal temperature for cooked hamburgers to155 f 861 c fda personal communication 1993 regulatory actions stimulated by the outbreak described in this reportand the recovery of thousands of contaminated patties before they could beconsumed emphasize the value of rapid public health investigations ofoutbreaks the public health impact and increasing frequency of isolation ofthis pathogen underscore the need for improved surveillance for infectionscaused by e coli o157h7 and for hus to better
