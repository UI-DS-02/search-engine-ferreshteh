mhollowaicsunysbedu michael holloway writesheres your error i really do think this shows some confusion on youpart drum roll please science isnt so much the gathering of evidencto support an assertion read hypothesis as it is the gathering oempirical observations in order to make an hypothesis what shoulconvince you or not shouldnt be the final product so much as how thproduct was madeheres your error there is no observation or hypothesis that is not tainteby theory i have a theory i make observations those observations will bmade with my theory in mindyes absolutely though id make the observation in a more general sense oall observations are made by human beings and therefore made with varioubiasesbut here your message leaves talk of hypothesis and gets back once againto equating the business of science with the end result the gizmo producedscience works very well at developing theoriewithin paradigms but is very poor at dealing with paradigm shifts if idevelop a novel paradigm that explains homeopathy chinese medicine orspontaneous combustion if the paradigm is useful it will show me the wato make observations that prove or disprove itmy point isnt so much whether or not you have a novel paradigm but howyou come about developing itthe paradigm of modern medicine is that the body can be reduced to a set oessentially mechanical operations wherein disease is seen as malfunctions ithe machinery essentially the old newtonian model of the world it seemlikely that theories based upon this paradigm do not give a completediscription of the universe medicine healing etc indeed we nowrecognize an important psychological component to healingperhaps youd admit that this is an oversimplification on your part the topiof the philosophy of science is made for them im making them too but think that it also summarizes popular misconceptions of science and thebusiness of doing science biomedical research doesnt make any basicassumptions that arent the same as any other discipline of scientifiresearch that is that you make empirical observations form an hypothesiand test it modern medicine has much more to do with biochemistry thanthe old newtonian model of the world and i doubt that many psychologistwould appreciate being put outside this empirical world view psychologalso has more to do with biochemistry than spoon bendingit is also important to distinguish reason from science science may breasonable but so are many nonscientific methodologies aristotle reasonethat frogs came from mud by observing one hop out of a puddleoversimplified of course but a good example this is an empirical observation it was then tested though perhaps not by aristotle and eventuallyfound wanting in the meantime some folk willhave continued to believe in the spontaneous generation of animal life theres nothing at all surprising about this its the way the gathering oknowledge works there are probably more than a few things in my owndiscipline of molecular biology that will be found to be totally offbaseeven idiotic to someone in the future these future people wont have comto these relevations because they had suddenly gone all zenlike and hada vision in an lsd trip someone will have thought of something new andtested it this is the bit that people who seem to relish misrepresentinscience and research cant seem to wrap their minds around science is acreative process what i think of as factual and good research can be totallturned on its head tommorrow by new results and theories again i think it gets down to defining what you mean by science i oftedont recognize what it is that i do and am involved in in the way sciencis portrayed by popular media or writings of people in the humanities theportray science as a collection of immutable facts pronouncements of trutin big gold letters thats silly its as though we just go into the labturn over a stone and come up with a mechanism for transcriptional regulation its much more interesting than that it really is a very humaprocess
