banschbachvmsocomokstateedu writesto candida blooms following the use of broadspectrum antibiotics gordenrubenfeld through email has assured me that most physicians recognizethe chance of candida blooms occuring after broadspectrum antibiotic useand they therefore reinnoculate their patients with good bacteria torestore competetion for candida in the body i do not believe that this isyet a standard part of medical practice nor is it mine what i tried to explain to marty was that it is clearl understood that antibiotic exposure is a risk factor for fungal infection which is not the same as saying bacteria prevent fungal infections marty made this sound like a secret known only to veternarians an biochemists anyone who has treated a urinary tract infection known this at some centers preop liver transplant patients receive bowe decontamination directed at retaining good anaerobic flora in an attemp to prevent fungal colonization in this soontobe high risk group i als use lactobacillus to treat enteral nutrition associated diarrhea that ma be in part due to alterations in gut flora however it is not part o my routine practice to reinnoculate patients with good bacteria afte antibiotics i have seen no data on this practice preventing or treatin fungal infections in at risk patients whether or not it is a logica extension from the available observations ill leave to those of you wh base strong opinions and argue over such speculations in the absence o clinical trials one place such therapy has been described is in treating particularl recalcitrant cases of c difficile colitis not a fungal infection ther are case reports of using stool ie someone elses enemas to repopulat the patients flora dont try this at homenot give give her advise to use the otc antifungal creams since candidacolonizes primarily in the anorectal area gi symptoms should be more commonthan vaginal problems after broadspectrum antibiotic use except that it isnt at least symptomatically apparent diseasemedicine has not and probalby never will be practiced this way therehas always been the use of conventional wisdom a very good example iskidney stones conventional wisdombecause clinical trails have not beendone to come up with an effective prevention was that restricitng theintake of calcium and oxalates was the best way to prevent kidney stonesfrom forming clinical trials focused on drugs or ultrasonic blasts tobreakdown the stone once it formed through the recent new england j ofmedicine article we now know that conventional wisdom was wrongincreasing calcium intake is better at preventing stone formation than isrestricting calcium intake seems like this is an excellent argument for ignoring anecdota conventional wisdom a euphemism for no data and doing a good clinica trial like au dismukeswe wadejs leejy dockerybk hainjd ti a randomized doubleblind trial of nystatin therapy for th candidiasis hypersensitivity syndrome see comments so nengljmed 1990 dec 20 32325 p 171723 psychological tests results the three activetreatment regimen and the allplacebo regime significantly reduced both vaginal and systemic symptoms p less tha 0001 but nystatin did not reduce the systemic symptom significantly more than placebo conclusions in women with presumed candidiasi hypersensitivity syndrome nystatin does not reduce systemic o psychological symptoms significantly more than placebo consequently the empirical recommendation of longterm nystatin therapy for suc women appears to be unwarranted does this trial address every issue raised here no jon noring was no surprised at this negative trial since they didnt use sporanox despit crooks recommendation for nystatin maybe they didnt avoid thos carbohydrates the conventional wisdom in animal husbandry has been that animals need tobe reinnoculated with good bacteria after coming off antibiotic therapyif it makes sense for livestock why doesnt it make sense for humansdavid we are not talking about a dangerous treatmentunless you consideryogurt dangerous if this were a standard part of medical practice asgordon r says it is then the incidence of gi distress and vaginal yeastinfections should decline marty youve also changed the terrain of the discussion from empiri itraconazole for undocumented chronic fungal sinusitis with systemi hypersensitivity symptoms noring syndrome to the yoghurt and vitami therapy of undocumented candida enteritis elaine palmer syndrome wit systemic symptoms there is significant difference between the cost an risk of these two empiric therapeutic trials are we talking about real candida infections the whole yeast connection hypothesis the efficac of routine bacterial repopulation in humans or the ability of anecdotall effective therapies challenged by a negative randomized trial to confir an etiologic hypothesis post hoc ergo propter hoc we cant seem t focus in on a disease a therapy or a hypothesis under discussion im lostcandida can do that to you gordon i think that the best clinicaltrial for candida blooms would involve giving women with chronic vaginalcandida blooms l acidophilus orally and see it it can decrease thefrequency and extent of candida blooms in the vagina since most of thecandida seems to be migrating in from the anal region and l acidophilusshould be able keep the candida in check if it can make it through theintestinal tract and colonize in the anus where it will have access tooxygenjust like it does in the vagina as much stuff as there is in thelay press about l acidophilus and vaginal yeast infections im reallyamazed that someone has not done a clinical trial yet to check it outthe calcium and kidney stone story is not a good reason to throw allconventional wisdom out the window where would medicine be ifconventional wisdom had not been used to develop many of the standardmedical practices that could not be confirmed through clinical trialsthe clinical trial is a very new arrival on the medical sceneand a veryimportant one the lack of proof that reinnoculation with good bacteriaafter antibiotic use is important to the health of a patient is no reasonto dismiss it outofhand especially if reinnoculation can be done cleaplyand safelylike it is in animal husbandrymarty b
