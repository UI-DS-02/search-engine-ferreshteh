as promised below is a personal critique of a pressure point massageri recently bought from the self care catalog i am very pleased withthe results the catalog description is as follows tthe pressure point massager is an aggressive physical massager tthat actually kneads the tension out of muscles much like tprofessional shiatsu masseur the powerful motor drives tw tcounter rotating thumbs that move in one inch orbits treleasing tension in the neck back legs and arms tpressure point massager a2623 10to order or receive a catalog call 24 hours 7 days 1 800 345 3371 ofax at 1 800 345 4021 notewhen i ordered the massager the item number was different and the pricwas 179 not 109 when i received it i glanced thru the newer cataloenclosed with it to see anything was different from the first one i was quite annoyed to see a 70 difference in price i called them about itand the cust rep said that they had switched manufacturers although ilooks and works exactly the same he told me to go ahead and return thfirst one and order the cheaper one using the price difference as reason for return in fact since the newer ones might take a while tship from the factory i received this one in 3 days he told me i coulduse the one i already have until the new one arrives then return the oldone very reasonable people i have long term neck shoulder and back pain if i were a building iwould be described as structurally unsound i have stretchesand exercises to do that help but the problem never really goes away if for whatever reason i do not exercise for a while illness not enougtime lazy etc the muscles become quite stiff and painful and thus more prone to further strain even with exercise i sometimes requirephysical therapy to get back on track which 1st requires a doctor visitto get the prescription for p t the tension in my neck if not released eventually causes a headach sometimes confused with a sinus headache over my left eye when myphysical therapist has massaged my neck and the sub occipital musclesin particular the 2 knobby areas near the base of the skull theheadache usually eased within a day although it hurts like hell towhile it is being massagedi ordered this device because it seemed to be exactly what i was wishinsomeone would invent a machine that would massage not vibrate myneck and sub occipital muscles like my physical therapist has done inthe past that i could use by myself no doctor visit or inconvenientp t appts for a week later would be needed to use it i could get upin the middle of the night and use it if necessaryi have been using it for about a week or so now and love it the basunit is about a 14 x 9 rectangle about 3 3 4 high with handles on eacside and it plugs into an average outlet the two metal thumbs are about1 1 2 in diameter and protrude about 2 1 2 above the base the thumbsare covered with a gray cloth that is non removable they are located moretoward one end rather than centered see figure below they move ineither clockwise or counter clockwise directions depending on which sideof the switch is pushed and are very quiet it can be used from eitheside for instance the thumbs can be positioned at the base of the necor the top of the neck depending on which direction you approach it t t t t t t t for the neck head the user varies the amount of pressure used by iflaying down allowing all or part of the full weight of the head and orneck to rest on the thumbs the handles can also be used if sitting ostanding applying pressure with the arms wrists since my wrists aralso impaired i m typing this over an extended period of time and idon t have someone living with me who can apply it laying down workswell for mefor my back i sit in a high backed kitchen chair position the massagebehind me at whatever point i want massaged and lean back lightly onot so lightly against it the pressure of leaning back holds it in place if i want to massage the entire spine i simply move it down a few incheswhenever i feel like it for my back this machine is far superior to usethan the commonly used home made massager of 2 tennis balls taped together with the balls position against a wall or door them over the spine andmove the body up and down against them the tennis balls are better thannothing but difficult to use for very long especially if your quads arenot in good shape and my long hair gets painfully in the way if i don tpin it up first as far as i m concerned the easier something like thisis to use the more likely i ll use do it if there are multipleconsiderations hassles i m more likely to not bother with itnot only has this machine helped with my headaches but my range of motionfor my neck and back are greatly increased the first time i used it on mneck sub occipital muscles however i overdid it and pressed too haragainst it which resulted in a very tender almost bruised area for few days i laid off it for about 3 days and applied ice which helped after that i was more gradual about applying pressure at this point the pain in the sub occipital area is now minimal while being massaged i also learned to use very light pressure on my lower back which is themost vulnerable point for meit also eased some painful knots of tension between my shoulder bladesalthough again it took a few days of massaging just a few minutes aa time to really work it outi highly recommend this product if you have similar problems although cannot vouch for its durability it seems pretty sturdy since i ve hait such a short time i plan to use it not only to ease tension but alsoto loosen the muscls before exercising and maybe after too i havbeen ill recently and not able to exercise much for a few weeks so thiswas very timely for methis is the 1st product i ve ordered from this company and only recentlbecame aware of it thru a co worker the catalog states they have beein business since 1976 it contains quite a few health care products andwhile they appear to be more expensive than the average health care cataloproducts they also appear to be of much higher quality with more thoughput into what they actually do definitely a step above some other onei ve seen such as dr leonards health care catalog or mature wisdom i m only 37 but have ended up on some geriatric type mailing lists nbig surprise here i consider many of those products to be rip offs particularly targeted toward the elderly with dubious health benefitsi apologize for the length of this but it s the kind of info i wouldlike to know before ordering something thru the mailrobin coutellier northern telecom
