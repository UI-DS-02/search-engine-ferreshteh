i have a fairly severe high frequency hearing loss a recent rough tes showed a gently sloping loss to 10 20db down at 1000cps then it falls of a cliff to 70 80dbs down from 1500cps on this type of loss is difficul to fit i am currently using some old siemens behind the ear aids whic keep me roughly functional but leave a lot to be desired recently i had an opportunity to test the widex q8 behind the ear aids fo several weeks these have four independent programs which are intended t be customized for different hearing situations and can be reprogramed found them to be a definite improvement over my current aids and was abou to go ahead with them until another local outfit advertised a free trial o another programmable system called resound unfortunately i was only able to try the resound aids in their office fo about 30 minutes and i couldn t compare them head to head with the widex nevertheless it did appear to me that they were superior and i wa impressed by what i was able to read about the theory behind them which will give in a separate posting they also carry the widex aids and had on patient presumably wealthy who decided to go ahead and get the resoun even though he had purchased the widex only 6 months ago the problem is that the resound aids are about twice as expensive as th widex and other programmable aids i could take a trip to europe on th difference being a lover of bargains and hating to spend money i a having a hard time persuading myself to go with the resounds i woul appreciate any opinions on this and other hearing aids and projection about when and if i might see improvements in technology that aren t quit so expensive your hearing curve sounds a lot like mine thanks uncle sam i ve beewearing miracle ear canal aids for about 5 months now and i find them to bacceptable they are molded to the shape of your ear canal and tuned toyour hearing curve they are comfortable to wear and almost invisible iyou re worried about that although if you re currently wearing behind thear models that s not an issue the cost i paid 1200 each for minethrough the miracle ear counter at sears i ve heard that there is substantial discount for senior citizens but i haven t researched that becausi m not a senior citizen yetgive them a try you might be pleasantly surprised alan hepburn a man doesn t know what he knownational semiconductor until he knows what he doesn t know santa clara ca alan berlioz nsc com thomas carlyl
