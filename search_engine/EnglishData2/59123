in hastening global health interdependence itis not the only illness doing so diseases such as malaria and many respiratory and intestinal pathogens have similarly inhibited the economicdevelopment of most of humanity and acted to marginalize large populations berkley mentions the enormous social and economic impact that aids will haveon many developing countries and the increased need for

state even at a cost of diverting lessattention to some other illnesses writes seth berkley of the rockefellerfoundation in new york ny in reply to a letter by drs gellert andnordenberg although it is true that diseases other than aids such asmalaria and respiratory and intestinal illnesses have similarly inhibited economic development in developing countries and deserve much more attentionthan they are getting berkley disagrees with the contention that aids isreceiving too much attention hiv differs from other diseases in mostdeveloping countries because it is continuing to spread for most endemicdiseases the outcome of neglecting interventions for one year is anotheryear of about the same level of needless disease and death but with aidsand its increasing spread the cost of neglect not only in disease burdenbut financially is much greater interventions in the early part of arampantly spreading epidemic like hiv are highly costeffective because eachindividual infection prevented significantly interrupts transmission berkleysays he agrees with gellert and nordenberg about the gigantic social and economic effects of aids and about the need for political leadership but

itself not an opportunistic infection caused scalingskin conditions to develop in mice carrying the genes for hiv although thehiv genes were active in the mice they did not compromise the animalsimmunity the researchers found this led them to conclude that the hivitself caused the skin diseaseour findings support a growing body of evidence that hiv can cause diseasewithout affecting

humanretrovirusesdeveloping animal models of hiv infection has been difficult since mostanimals including mice cannot be infected by the virus to bypass thisproblem scientists have developed hivtransgenic mice which carry genes forhiv as well as their own genetic materialnidr scientists created the transgenic mice by injecting hiv genes into mouseeggs and then implanting the eggs into female mice the resulting litterscontained both normal and transgenic animalsinstitute scientists had created mice that carried a complete copy of hivgenetic material in l988 those mice however became sick and died too soonafter birth to study in depth in the present study the scientists used anincomplete copy of hiv which allowed the animals to live longersome of the transgenic animals developed scaling wartlike tumors on theirnecks and backs other transgenic mice developed thickened crusting skinlesions that covered most of their bodies resembling psoriasis in humans noskin lesions developed in their normal nontransgenic littermatesstudies of tissue taken from the wartlike skin tumors showed that they were atype of noncancerous tumor called papilloma although the papillomavirus cancause

scientists found no evidence however of compromised immunity in themice no increase in their white blood cell count and no signs of commoninfections the fact that hiv genes were active but the animals immunesystems were not suppressed confirms that the virus itself was causing theskin lesions dr kopp saidfurther proof of hiv gene involvement came from a test in which the scientistsexposed the transgenic animals to ultraviolet light the light increased hivgenetic activity causing papillomas to develop on formerly healthy skin papilloma formation in response to increased hiv genetic activity
