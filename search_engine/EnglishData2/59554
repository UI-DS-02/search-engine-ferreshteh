ive sent gordon r my posts on protein vitamin c and vitamin a prior toposting on internet as a professional courtesy somehow ive managed todelete my vitamin a post from my text file gordon r had promised to sendit back to me but hes pretty mad at me right now so ill just retype itsince digging through all my references is very time consumingtook me allday for that pms post im not going to cite any referencesgordon r hasthem im going to include some of the material from weinsier andmorgans new nutrition textbookwhich was not in my original material topoint out that what im going to say has some support in the medicalcommunitydiet has been know to affect the immune system of man for a very very longtime protein has always had the biggest role in infection and ivealready covered the role of protein in protecting you against infectionnow im going to hit what i consider to be the most important nutrient inthe us as far as infection is concernedvitamin awhen vitamin a was originally discovered it was commonly referred to asthe antiinfection vitamin many peoplelinus pauling being one havedecided to take this title away from vitamin a and give it to vitamin which ive already covered big mistakein my opinion vitamin a isalso getting a reputation as an anticancer vitaminwith good reasonthe nci currently has numerous clinical trials in progress to see ifvitamin a can not only prevent cancer but cure it as well its role inboth cancer and infection is almost identicalbut not quitevitamin a comes in two completely different formsretinol andbetacarotene retinol is the animal form and its toxic betacaroteneis the plant form and its completely nontoxic both retinol and betacarotene display good absorption in the human gut if bile is presen6080 the liver stores all of your retinol and doles it out for othertissues to use by synthesizing retinol binding proteinrbp a normal humanadult liver should have 500000iu to 1000000iu of retinol stored weare born with 10000iu in our liver us autopsy has shown that about30 of americans die with the sameor less amount of vitamin a as theywere born with if you dont believe that nutritional reserveslike thatof retinol in the liver are important then this low vitamin a reserve isnot going to affect you but if you believelike i do that the nutrientreserves are important then there is a problem with vitamin a in the usthe us rda for vitamin a in an adult male is 1000 re or 5000iu ofvitamin a for adult feamles its 800 re or 4000iu of vitamin a dietsurveys show that most americans are getting this amount of vitamin either retinol or betacarotene from their diet but the nrcnationalresearch council was going to release a new rda table in 1985 that had therda for both vitamin a and vitamin c raisedc to 90mg per day and a to7500iu per day for adult males that report and its recommendations waskilled why concern over the increasing supplementation was the mainreason rdas are set to prevent clinical disease not to keep nutrientreserves full many scientist in the us feel that the time has come tomove away from the prevention of clinical pathology concept and movetowards the promotion of optimum health concept especially since we havesome very good data now that show that nutrient reserves are extremelyimportant during periods of stress the nutritonal concervatives won thatbattle and a new group of scientist were collected to come out with the1989 rda list which lowered the rda for several nutrients and moved thedietary guidelines back to where they were when we first started in the1940sget enough to prevent clinical pathology but not enough to fillthe reserveswe know from autopsy that only about 10 of americans have a liver with anormal vitamin a reserve500000iu to 1000000iu i preach nutrientreserves to my students and tell them to measure them in their patientsbut for vitamin a only a liver biopsyor autopsy data will tell you howmuch somebody has stored we can tell very easily if someone hasoverfilled his or her liver with vitamin a by measuring the serium retinollevellevels above 450ugdl are highly suggestive that you have filled yourliver with vitamin a and its time to stop taking retinol the normalrange of serum retinol will be 20100ugdl hypervitaminosis a isdiagnosed with a serum retinol level of 2000ugdl or higherinterpretationof diagnostic test wallach md a little brown series book this levelof vitamin a in blood means that medical attention is necessary due tovitamin a toxicity weinsier and morgan take a much more conservativeapproach to vitamin a toxicity than does wallach as you will see later inthis post between 450ugdl and 2000ugdl you should have plentyof warning that its time to eliminate the retinol from your dietheadacheredness of the skin hair loss joint paini tell all my students that will use vitamin a in their practice that theyhad better monitor the serum retinol level and stop when there are clearsigns that the liver is full you will never really know if the patientneeds the vitamin abecause you can not measure the pool in liver but youwill always know when its time to stopjust like in those vitamin a forpms studiesbetacarotene can be taken to fill up your liver with retinol and you willnever have to worry about toxicity because the conversion of betacarotene toretinol that occurs in both your gut and your liver will slow downstops in theliver and slows down in the gut when your liver is full of retinol buttaking betacarotene as the source of retinol takes a very long time tofill the liver upive seen estimates of 2030 years if you are in the 30that only has as much as you were born with in your liver10000iu oneother problem with betacarotene if you have a zinc deficit you will notconvert as much betacarotene to retinol in the gut or the liver because theenxzyme that does this conversion requires zinc in addition the release ofretinol from the liver is a zinc dependent process so a zinc deficit willcause a vitamin a deficit even if your liver has plenty of vitamin anow what does vitamin a do in cancer and infection protection the bodyuses vitamin aretinol for many different things visionthe first to benailed down and where you see overt clinical pathology uses the aldehydretinal and alcoholretinol form of vitamin a reproduction uses theretinol form and some retinal infection and cancer protection usesretinoic acid how do you convert retinolwhich your white blood cellsand the mucosal cells get from blood to retinoic acid you use enzymesone of which requires vitamin cthis is why pauling has tried to pull thetitle of antiinfection vitamin away from vitamin a vitamin c does playa role in infectioninterferon production for example but its biggest roleis the conversion of retinol to retinoic acid if you increase your intakeof vitamin c you will increase your formation of retinoic acid butretinoic acid can not be converted back to retinolas retinal can and onceits formed its used and then lost to the body this is why the 1985 nrcgroup wanted to increase both vitamin c and vitamin a rdasmost people taking large amounts of vitamin c really think that they arehelping themselves if they dont have much vitamin a in their liver andthey are not also increasing their intake of vitamin a they actually dothemselves more harm than goodretinoic acid functions in white blood cells to promote antibody formationin the mucus membrane it is the main factor in promoting good mucusproduction and a good epithelial cell barrier to prevent infectious agents fromentering the blood system the mucus membrane is referred to as the firstline defense against infection for cancer retinoic acid has been shownto act as a cell brakeit counteracts the effect of cell promoters whichstimulate cells to divide cancer has two distinct steps dna alterationand cell promotion for cells that normally divide all the time promotersare not that important but for lung and breast tissue which does notnormally divide promoters are real important in the malignant processthis is the major reason why the nci has so many different clinical trialsin progress using retinol andor betacarotenechronic infectionirritation of the mucus membranes is a signal thatvitamin a may not be adequate i tell my students that any patient whowalks into their office with a complaint of chronic infection has to beworked up for vitamin aalong with the other factors that medicine alreadyhas on its list of causes for chronic infection i drive this home in mycourse at the osteopathic college in tulsa when i teach at the allopathicmedical school in tulsaous branch campus and when i give cme lecturesdark adaptation is the best clinical test for vitamin a status since nightvision is impacted when liver reverves drop to 50000iu of retinol theserum level of retinol can also be used but it does not drop until liverreserves drop below 10000 to 20000iu asking a patient if they havetrouble seeing at night is a good initial screenif cataracts are ruledout in one study done on us spanishamericans where serum retinol levelswere measured 25 of the sample population had a serum retinol level below20ugdlas more studies are done on serum retinol levels in population groups ofthe us that have had a history of high infection rates we will probablysee a much stonger correlation between infection incidence rates and lowserum retinol levelswhat do weinsier and morgan have to say about vitamin a here are excerptfrom their bookvitamin a functions in vision in the forrm of retinol it is necessay forgrowth and differentation of epithelial tissue and is required forreproduction embryonic development and bone growth proteincaloriemalnutrition and zinc deficiency may impair the absorption transport andmetabolism of vitamin a retinaldehyde is converted to retinoic acidwhich has biological activity in growth and in cell diferentiation but notin reproduction or vision the most common procedure to evaluate vitamin astatus is to measure the retinol level in plasma or serum the normalrange for vitamin a content for a child is 20 to 90ugdl lower values areindicators of deficiency or depleted body stores serum levels greaterthan 100ugdl are indicative of toxic levels of vitamin a dark adaptationtests and electroretinogram measurements are also useful but difficult toperform on young children rapidly proliferating tissues are sensitive tovitamin a deficiency and may revert to an undifferentiated state thebronchorespiratory tract skin genitourinary system gastrointestinaltract and sweat glands are adversely affected a daily intake of more than75mgabout 37000iu of retinol is not advised and chronic use of amountsover 20mg100000iu can result in a dry and itching skin desquamationerythematous dermatitis hair loss joint pain chapped lips hyperostoibony depositis headaches anorexia edema and fatigue they recommend 30mg of retinol via im injection in children for vitamin adeficiency but do not discuss treatment for adults their toxic serum retinollevel is very conservative i recommend that my students try 25000iu inadults that are having problems with chronic infection they have to ruleout a zinc deficit first by getting an rbc zinc runor if their clinicallab cant run it i tell them to do what weinsier and morgan suggest givethem the zinc along with the vitamin a at 25000iu per day toxicityshould not be a problem and you will not have to worry about pulling thepatient into the office on a regular basis to run a serum retinolboth elaine and jon found doctors who used a much higher dose of vitamin arecall that the pms papers were using 100000iu to 200000iu of vitamin ai dont suggest that my students use these high doses if you wanted tofill the liver up fastas part of a clinical trial and were monitoring theserum retinol level then you would be okay but my knowledge of thevitamin a literature suggests to me that 25000iu for patients with ademonstrated vitamin a deficitdark adapatation test or serum retinol willprovide a good and steady improvementas long as zinc and vitamin c statusare good without having to worry about toxicity if they want to get moreagressive fine if they follow my advise to check the serum retinol butvitamin aretinol should never be given in high dose to women who couldbecome pregnant since vitamin a shows teratogenicity towards the humanfetus the dose needed to show this effect on the developing fetus is18000iu of retinol per day betacarotene will never have this effect onthe human fetuscould just taking betacarotene instead of retinol supplements help yesbut the effect will take a long time to develop my advise is to useretinol to fill the liver up and then switch to betacarotene to keep itfull vitamin a is probably one nutrient that is better off left toprescription by doctors but when we have the mds in this newsgroupjumping all over me and other doctors that propose the use of vitamin asupplements for treating patients with chronic sinus and gi distress ithink that the most prudent option is to keep vitamin a in the otc marketbut require manufactors to provide package inserts to educate the generalpublic about the dangers of vitamin a supplementationmarty b
