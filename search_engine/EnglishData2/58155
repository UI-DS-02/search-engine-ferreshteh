my biggest resentment is the doctor who makes it seem like mospeople with dizziness can be cured thats definitely not thcase in most cases like i said above it is a long tediouprocess that may or may not end up in a partial cure be sure to say chronic dizziness not just dizziness mospatients with acute or subacute dizziness will get betterthe vertiginous spells of menieres will also eventually gaway however the patient is left with a deaf earall true and all good pointsto anyone suffering with vertigo dizziness or any variatiothereof my best advice to you as a fellowsufferer is thisjust keep searchingdont let the doctors tell you therenothing that can be donedo your own researchand let youthis may have helped you but im not sure it is good generaadvice the odds that you are going to find some miracle wityour own research that is secret or hidden from general knowledgfor this or any other disease are slim when good answers to thesthen spending a great deal of time and energy on the medicaproblem may divert that energy from more productive thingin life a limited amount should be spent to assure yourselthat your doctor gave you the correct story but after it becomeclear that you are dealing with a problem for which medicinhas no good solution perhaps the best strategy is to joithe support group and keep abreast of new findings but not tmake a career out of itwell making a career out of it is a bit strong i still believthat doing your own research is very very necessary i woulnot have progressed as much as i have today unless i had spenthe many hours in stanfords med library as i have doneand 5 years ago it was clear that there was no medicine thatwould help me so should i have stopped searching thangoodness i didnt now i found that there is indeed medicinthat helps me i think that what youve said is kind of idealistic that yowould go to one doctor get a diagnosis maybe get a seconopinion and then move on with your lifejust as an example having seen 6 of the top specialists inthis field in the country i have received 6 different diagnosesthese are the top names the ones that people come to from all ovethe country i have had to sort all of this out myself gointo a support group and in fact heading that support group washelpful for a while but after a point i found it verunproductive it was much more productive to do library researchmake phone calls and put together the pieces of the puzzle myselfa recent movie lorenzos oil offers a perfect example of whaim talking about if you havent seen it you should its noa put down of doctors and neither is what im saying doctors aronly human and can only do so much but there are those of uout here who are intelligent and able to sometimes find a missinpiece of the puzzle that might have otherwise gone unnoticedi guess im biased because dizziness is one of those weird thingthat is still so unknown if i had a broken arm or a weak heartor failing kidneys i might not have the same opinion thats becausethose things are much more tangible and have much more concisedefinitions and treatments with dizziness you just have tdecide to live with it or decide to live with it while trying tfind your way out of iti have chosen the latterlindlindaenetcomnetcomcogordon banks n3jxp skepticism is the chastity of the intellect angebcadredslpittedu it is shameful to surrender it too soon
