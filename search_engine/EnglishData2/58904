see the ulterior motive here it is easy for me to see it th those physicians who call everything lyme and treat everything there is a lot of money involved tyou keep bringing this up but i don t understand what s in i financially for the physician to go ahead and treat unless the physicia has an investment in or is involved in some kickback scheme with th home infusion company where is the financial gain for the doctor well let me put it this way based on my own experience general practitioner with no training in infectious diseases by establishing links to the lyme community treating patient who come to him wondering about lyme or having decided the have lyme as if they did saying that diseases such as m are probably spirochetal if not lyme giving talks at meeting of users groups validating the feelings of even delusiona patients etc this gp can go from being a run of the mil 100k yr gp to someone with lots of patients in the hospita and getting expensive infusions that need monitoring in hi office and making lots of bread also getting the adulatio of many who believe his is their only hope if not of cure then of control and seeing his name in publications put ou by support groups etc this is a definite temptation tharumph getting published in these newsletters is hardly somethinto aspire to ti can t really argue with your logic though i think you may bextrapolating a bit recklessly from what appears to be a sample size oone even if what you say about this local pittsburgh guy is true it inot logical or fair to conclude that this is true of all doctors whtreat lyme disease tby your logic i could conclude that all of the physicians whconsult for insurance companies and make money by denying benefits tlyme patients are doing it for the money rather than because they believthey are encouraging good medicine i have no idea how sincere these guyare but their motives are as suspect as the physicians you excoriate fowhat you believe to be indiscriminate treatment ti would really feel more comfortable discussing the medical issuein lyme rather than speculating as to the motives of the various partieinvolved gordon banks n3jxp skepticism is the chastity of the intellect an geb cadre dsl pitt edu it is shameful to surrender it too soon carl brenne
