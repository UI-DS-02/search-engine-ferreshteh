hate to wreck your elaborate theory but steve dyer is not an mdso professional jealosy over doctors who help their patients witnystatin etc can t very well come into the picture stevdoesn t have any patients response to specificially candida albicans and i showed a strong positive another question would everybody show the same strong positive so this tes is essentially useless and assuming it is true that candida can groyes everyone who is normal does that we use candida on the other arwhen we put a tuberculin test on if people don t react to candidawe assume the tb test was not conclusive since such people may noreact to anything all normal people have antibodies to candidaif not you would quickly turn into a fungus ball this brings up an interesting observation used by those who will den and reject any and all aspects of the yeast hypothesis until th appropriate studies are done and that is if you can t observe or cultur the yeast bloom in the gut or sinus then there s no way to diagnose o even recognize the disease and i know they realize that it is virtuall impossible to test for candida overbloom in any part of the body that canno be easily observed since candida is everywhere in the body it s a real catch 22you ve just discovered one of the requirements for a good quack theoryfind something that no one can disprove and then write a book sayinit is the cause of whatever since no one can disprove it you carake in the bucks for quite some time i have often wondered what an m d with chronic gi distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his patients is a non existent syndromethat is odd isn t it why do you suppose it is that mds with thescommon problems don t go for these crazy ideas does the professionajealosy extend to suffering in silence even though they know thecould be cured if they just followed this quack book gordon banks n3jxp skepticism is the chastity of the intellect angeb cadre dsl pitt edu it is shameful to surrender it too soon
