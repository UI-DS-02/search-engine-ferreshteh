nutrasweet is a synthetic sweetener a couple thousand times sweeter thasugar some people are concerned about the chemicals that the body produceswhen it degrades nutrasweet it is thought to form formaldehyde and known tfor methanol in the degredation pathway that the body uses to eliminatesubstances the real issue is whether the levels of methanol and formaldehydproduced are high enough to cause significant damage as both are toxic tliving cells all i can say is that i will not consume it aspartame is the methyl ester of a dipeptide so a product of ithydrolysis is going to be methanol which can then be oxidized tformaldehyde the amounts of methanol formed from the ingestion oaspartamecontaining foods are completely in the metabolic noisesince youre forming equally minute amounts of methanol from othecomponents of food all the time in studies involving administratioof high doses of the additive blood methanol levels were undetectablemethanol is a poison only in quantities seen in human poisoningssay 5ml and above this is a consequence of its oxidation to formaldehydand formic acid two quite reactive compounds which at high enough levelcan damage tissues like the retina and kidney because at such high dosethe bodys detoxification system is overwhelmed interestingly ontreatment for early methanol poisoning is to get the person drunk oethyl alcoholvodka or an equivalent thats because ethanol imetabolized preferentially over methanol by the enzymes in the liverif the methanol stays as methanol and isnt metabolized to formaldehydeit is actually relatively nontoxicsteve dyedyerursamajorspdcccom aka imaharvardrayssdlinusm2cspdccdye
