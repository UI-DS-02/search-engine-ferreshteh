increase in gonorrhea rather than a reporting artifacthowever the stable culturepositivity rate in the nonprofit family planninglaboratory which serves a network of clinics statewide indicates that thegonorrhea increase did not uniformly affect all segments of the population one possible explanation for the increased occurrence of gonorrhea incolorado may be gang and drugrelated sexual behavior

beendeveloped that include ivfet gamete intrafallopian tube transfer giftembryo cryopreservation freezing and gamete micromanipulation togetherthese technologies are referred to as the hightech assisted reproductivetechnology art proceduresovulation induction sperm insemination and surgery for tubal disease andorpathology still are the mainstays of the therapies available for infertilitymanagement however when these fail it almost always is appropriate toproceed with one of the art procedurestherefore in addition to a comprehensive basic and general infertilityservice at the university of arizona center for reproductive endocrinology andinfertility there is a program of assisted reproduction that specializes inart procedures this program serves as a tertiary provider for those patientsin the state of arizona whose infertility problems cannot be resolved by thetraditional therapiesthe following article on back describes the art procedures available in ourcenter clarifies appropriate applications for each and considers therealistic expectations for their success procedures included areo in vitroo fertilization embryo transfer ivfet gamete intrafallopian tube

couples we are developing the technology to assistcouples who are at risk for producing embryos with a serious hereditarydiseasethis technology involves biopsying the preimplantation human embryo and thensubjecting the biopsied cells to genetic analysis using either dnaamplification or fluorescent in situ hybridizationthere are recent reports of the successful application of dna amplification byother centers for example for diagnosis of the genes for cystic fibrosis andhemophilia we hope to apply and further focus fluorescent in situhybridization technology for probing the x chromosome the identification ofwhich will provide a scientific basis for counselling patients who exhibitsexlinked disordersthe considerable clinical application of such technology lies in the fact thatit

following are the art procedures available at the university of arizonacenter for reproductive endocrinology and infertility in vitro fertilization embryo transfer is the core art procedure of ourassisted reproduction program this procedure involves retrieval ofunfertilized eggs from the ovary their insemination in vitro in a dish andthe culture of resultant embryos for 1 or 2 days before they are transferredto the patients uterus all cultures are maintained in an incubator understrictly controlled atmospheric and temperature conditions before beingprocessed for use in insemination semen samples are evaluated in ourandrology laboratory using both subjective light microscopy and computerhicnet medical newsletter page 2volume 6 number 10 april 20 199assisted semen analyses to ensure an adequate number of eggs with which toperform ivfet or indeed gift follicular development is typicallystimulated with gonadotropins perganol metrodin gonadotropin releasinghormone gnrh factrel lutrepulse andor gnrh analogues lupron depolupron synarel occasionally however ivfet is accomplished with eggsobtained in nonstimulated cycles while some programs utilize laparoscopicegg retrieval in the operating room with the patient under general anesthesiawe undertake the less costly approach of ultrasoundguided retrieval in ourinfertility unit with the patient sedated couples who resort to ivfet exhibit such pathologies as tubaldeficiencies ovulatory dysfunction endometriosis andor mild forms of malefactor infertility according to the united states ivf registry the overallsuccess rate for ivfet nationwide has stabilized at about 14 percent percycle results from our program involving 86 patients who have undergone 173ivfet cycles reflect a comparable success rate nevertheless the overall incidence of success with this procedure isdisconcertingly low and emphasizes the need to address those physiologicalfactors that limit achievement of a higher percentage of pregnancies wellrecognized predictors of outcome include patient age response to exogenousovarian stimulation quality of sperm and number of repeated ivfet cycleattempts however among these age is the single most significant determinantof conception therefore it is critical that such patients are referred to anassisted reproduction program at the earliest opportunity following failure oftraditional therapies the underlying basis for the negative effect of age on fertility has notbeen clearly delineated beyond recognition that 1 the number of eggsavailable for retrieval declines markedly with age 2 fertilization ratessignificantly decrease in eggs retrieved from patients who are over 40 yearsand 3 provided the appropriate hormonal background is present age isunrelated to uterine competency to sustain pregnancy ongoing research in ourcenter therefore is investigating physiological changes in the egg that maybe impacted by age we have determined that more than 50 percent of eggs thatfail to fertilize in vitro are chromosomally abnormal and that a significantproportion of these abnormalities are accountable to patient age currentlythe only recourse for such patients is to use eggs obtained from a donor ourprogram has initiated recruitment of volunteer egg donors to satisfy the needsof a list of recipients interested in this form of therapy gift this hightech art procedure is performed in the operating roomusually with the use of a laparoscope and in contrast to ivfet involvesintroducing sperm and freshly retrieved eggs into the lumen of the fallopiantube an average of 3 eggstube under these circumstances fertilizationoccurs in vivo and if excess eggs are retrieved the remainder undergo ivfwith subsequent options for embryo transfer in that cycle or freezing fortransfer in a subsequent cycle this art procedure is applied to cases inhicnet medical newsletter page 2volume 6 number 10 april 20 199which there is at least one patent fallopian tube but the couple has suchpathologies as ovulatory dysfunction endometriosis male factor infertilityandor idiopathic infertility the data reported in the united states ivf registry for 1985 through 1990indicate that the overall success rate with gift is higher than that obtainedwith the ivfet technique range of clinical pregnancies for gift is 24 to 36percent and for ivfet 14 to 18 percent in view of this fact one mightexpect more patients to be treated with gift than ivfet however in ourprogram we have taken into account three basic concerns which whilesubstantially reducing the number of gift cycles performed benefit thepatient these concerns are 1 the increased costs associated with performinga procedure in the operating room 2 the risks albeit minimal of undergoinggeneral anesthesia and 3 the considerable benefits to be accrued fromobtaining direct information on the quality and fertilizability of the eggsand the developmental competency of resultant embryos the increased success with gift undoubtedly reflects the artificialenvironment provided by the laboratory in the ivfet procedure betweenjanuary 1 1991 and december 31 1992 we have performed a total of 12 giftcycles with an overall success rate of 20 percent embryo cryopreservation or freezing is applied in our program whenembryos result from residual gift eggs or from nontransferred ivf embryosthis procedure not only provides patients with a subsequent opportunity forsuccess at much reduced costs but also circumvents the legal and ethicalissues relating to disposal of supernumerary embryos therefore as stipulatedby the american fertility society ethical guidelines for art programs fromboth a practical and an ethical standpoint all assisted reproduction programsshould have the capability of cryopreserving human embrys gamete micromanipulation this art procedure which is still very newis applied to couples who are unaccepting of insemination with donor semen butwho have severe male factor infertility less than 10 million spermml incombination with fewer than 20 perccent motile sperm andor less than 10percent sperm with normal morphology we are currently developing theprocedure of subzonal insertion szi which entails injecting sperm underthe coating around the egg the barrier normally penetrated by the spermthrough enzymatic digestion available data from szi programs worldwide indicate that only 5 to 10percent of szi cycles result in a pregnancy this statistic undoubtedlyrelates to limitations imposed by abnormalities inherent in the spermtherefore we are currently focusing on the development of improved techniquesfor the recognition and selection of sperm chosen for manipulation suchefforts are unquestionably worthwhile in view of the fact that this technologyoffers the only realistic opportunity for severe male factor patients toestablish conceptioncatherine racowsky phdhicnet medical newsletter page 2volume 6 number 10 april 20 199associate professor and director of
