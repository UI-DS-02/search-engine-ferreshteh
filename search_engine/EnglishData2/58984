there has been no hard info provided about msg making people ill that s the point after allwhy don t you just look it up in the merk or check out the medical dictionarcite which a doctor mentioned earlier in this thread that s because these peer reviewed studies are not addressin the effects of msg in people they re looking at animal models you can t walk away from this and start ranting about gloom an doom as if there were any documented deleterious health effect demonstrated in humans note that i wouldn t have any argumen with a statement like noting that animal administration has pro duced the following blah blah we must be careful about it use in humans this is precisely not what you saidamong others see olney s excitotoxic food aditives relevance oanimal studies to human safety 1982 neurobehav toxicol teratolvol 6 455 462i m sure peta would love to hear your arguments tests have been done on rhesus monkeys as well i have never seen study where the mode of administration was intra ventricular the gl and asp were administered orally some studies used iv and sc intra ventricular is not a normal admin method for food tox studies for obvious reasons you must not have read the peer reviewed work that i referred to or you would never have come up with this brai injection bunk it most certainly is for neurotoxicology you know studies o glutamate involve more than food science whose talking about food science what is this comment supposed tmean neurotoxicology and tratology brain research nature progress in brain research all fine food science journals pardon me but where are you getting this from have you read th journals have you done a thorough literature search so point us to the studies in humans please i m familiar wit the literature and i ve never seen any which relate at all t olney s work in animals and the effects of glutamate on neuronsthen you would know that olney himself has casually referred t chinese restaurant syndrome in a few articles why don t you poinus to some studies maybe then this exchange could be productive the point is exceeding the window of course they re amino acids note that people with pku cannot tolerate any phenylalanine well actually they have to tolerate some phenylalanine it s essential amino acid they just try to get as little as is health without producing dangerous levels of phenylalanine and its metabolite in the bloodthey re unable to metabolise it olney s research compared infant human diets specifically the amoun of freely available glu in mother s milk versus commercial baby foods vs typical lunch items from the standard american diet such as package soup mixes he found that one could exceed the projected safety margi for infant humans by at least four fold in a single meal of processe foods mother s milk was well below the effective dose goodness i m not saying that it s good to feed infants a lot o glutamate supplemented foods it s just that this projected safet margin is a construct derived from animal models and given that you can prove anything you like we re talking prudent policy i infant nutrition here yet you re misrepresenting it as received wisdomwho said anything about received wisdom there is no question thaorally administered doses of msg are capable of destroying nearly alneurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and the mediaeminence these areas are responsible for the production ohormones critical to normal neuroendocrine function and the normadevelopment of the vertabrate organism humans are vertebrates nowhat pray tell do you think will happen when the area of the brainecessary for the normal rhythm of gonadotropin release is missingare you trying to say that humans have no need of their pituitaryanh and me of that part of the brain that is responsible focontrolling the realease albeit indirectly of estradiol and testosterone how do you expect anyone to do the studies on this it s unethical t sacrifice humans to check out what effects chronic acute etc doseof these compounds are having on the brain tissue in humans the fooindustry knows this that s why the animal model is used in medicinand psych if you re talking about straight sensitivity it would buseful to define the term there are plenty of studies opsychoneuroimmunology showing the link between attitude anphysiologyi suspect we may be arguing about separate things only adult sensitivitie you and late occuring sequelae of childhood ingestion and itimplication for adults me certainlthe doses for excitotoxicity in adults are considerably larger thafor the young but the additivity of glu and asp and their copiouand increased presence in modern processed foods jointly and theihidden presence in hvp necessitates extreme caution why would anyonwant to eat compounds which have been shown to markedly perturb thendocrine system in adults the main point is blood levelsattained and oral doses would likely have to be greater than sc between who over what i would be most interested in seeing yo provide peer reviewed non food industry funded citations to article disputing that msg has no effects whatsoever you mean asserting you re being intellectually dishonest or jus plain confused because you re conflating reports which do not necessaril have anything to do with each other olney s reports would argue a potentia for problems in human infants but that s not to say that this says anythin whatsoever about the use of msg in most foods nor does he provide an studies in humans which indicate any deleterious effects for obviou reasons it says nothing about msg s contribtion to the phenomeno of the chinese restaurant syndrome it says nothing about the frequen inability to replicate anecdotal reports of msg sensitivity in the labolney s work provides a putative causal mechanism for somsensitivities terry epelbaum and martin have shown that oralladministered msg causes changes in normal gonadotropic hormonfluctutations in adults glu also was found to induce immediate and persistansupression of rhythmic gh secretion and to induce rapid and transienrelease of prolactin in adults chronically exposed to msg gh iresponsible not only for control of growth during development bualso converts glycogen into glucose could this be the cause oheadaches i don t know dyer ursa major spdcc com hmm com why am i not surprised dianne murray wcsbeau ccs carleton c probably one of the dumber remarks you ve madeif you had read olney s review article especially the remarks already quoted in an earlier post you would know to what i waalluding may i ask exactly for whom you do computer consulting
