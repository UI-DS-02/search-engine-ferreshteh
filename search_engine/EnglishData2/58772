gordon banks a lot to keep from going back to morbid obesity i think al of us cycle one s success depends on how large the fluctuation in the cycle are some people can cycle only 5 pounds unfortunately i m not one of themthis certainly describes my situation perfectly for me there ia constant dynamic between my tendency to eat which appears tbe totally limitless and the purely conscious desire to noput on too much weight when i get too fat i just diet exercismore with varying degrees of success to take off thextra weight usually i cycle within a 15 lb range busmaller and larger cycles occur as well i m always afraithat this method will stop working someday but usualli seem to be able to hold the weight gain in checkthis is one reason i have a hard time accepting the notioof some metabolic derangement associated with cycle dietin that results in long term weight gain i have been cycledieting for at least 20 years without seeing such a changei think a vigorous exercise program can go a long way towarkeeping the cycles smaller and the baseline weight lowbria
