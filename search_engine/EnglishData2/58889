what is wrong with the above observation is that it explicitly gives th impression and you may not in fact hold this view that the common perhap even the correct approach for a scientist to follow is to sit aroun having flights of fancy and scheming on the basis of his jealousies an petty hatreds flights of fancy and other irrational approaches are common the crucia thing is not to sit around just having fantasies they aren t of any us unless they make you do some experiments i ve known a lot of scientist whose fantasies lead them on to creative work usually they won t admi out loud what the fantasy was prior to the consumption of a few beersthe danger in philosophizing about science is that theory and generalizationcan end up being far removed from the actual day to day of the grunt at thbench yes its great to be involved in a process were i can walk into thlab after a heavy night of dreaming and just do something for the hell of i as long as my advisor doesn t catch me which is easy enough to do butstamping out such behavior seems to be the purpose in life of grant reviewcommittees and the peer review process in general in today s world that swhat determines what science is what gets funded and a damn good thing toflights of fantasy just don t have much chance of producing anything atleast not in biomedical research the surest way for a graduate student truin their life is to work in a lab where the boss is more concerned withfleshing out his her fantasies than with having the student work on a projecthat actually has a good chance of producing some results md s seem tobe particularly prone to this aberrant behavior simple example warren jelinek noticed an extremely heavy band on a dn electrophoresis gel of human alu fragments he got very excited hoping tha he d seen some essential part of the control mechanism for eukaryoti genes this fantasy led him to sequence samples of the band and carry ou binding assays the result was a well conserved 400 or so bp sequenc that occurs about 500 000 times in the human genome unfortunately fo warren s fantasy it turns out to be a transposon that is present i so many copies because it replicates itself and copies itself back int the genome on the other hand the characteristics of transposons wer much elucidated the necessity of a cellular reverse transcriptase wa recognized and the standard method of recognizing human dna was created other species have different sets of transposons fortunately for me warren and i used to eat dinner at t g i fridays all the time i have to agree with gary merrill s response to this i ve read alot of thalu and middle repetitive sequence work and it s really very interesting good work with implications for many fields in molecular genetics it sreally an example of how a well reasoned project turned up interestingresults that were unexpectedmik
