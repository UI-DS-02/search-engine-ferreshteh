someone wrote in expressing concern about getting aids from acupunctur needles unless your friend is sharing fluids with their acupuncturist who themselves has aids it is unlikely not impossible they will get aids from acupuncture needles generally even if accidently inoculated the norma immune response should be enough to effectively handle the minimal contaminant involved with acupuncture needle insertion isn t this what hiv is about the normal immune response to an exposure most acupuncturists use disposable needles use once and throw awayi had electrical pulse nerve testing done a while back the needles were takefrom a dirty drawer in an instrument cart and were most certainly nosterile or even clean for that matter more than likely they were fresfrom the previous patient i was concerned but i kept my mouth shut probably should have raised hellany comments no excuses
