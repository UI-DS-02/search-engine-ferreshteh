my wife has requested that i poll the sages of usenet to see what i known about the use of chromium in weightcontrol diet suppliments she has seen multiple products advertising it and would like any kin real information my first impulse was yuck a metal but i have zero data on it what do you know henry meltonill tell you all that i know about chromium but before i do i want toget a few things off my chest i just got blasted in email for my kidneystone posts kidney stones are primarily caused by diet as is heartdisease and cancer when i give dietary advise it is not intended toencourage people reading this news groupor sci med nutrition where i domost of my posting to avoid seeing a doctor nothing can be further fromthe truth kidney stones can be caused by tumors and this possibility has tobe ruled out but once it is diet is a good way of preventing a reoccurancesame thing with heart disease and cancer if you suspect that you may havea problem with one of these diseases dont use what im going to tell youor what you read in some book to avoid going to a doctor you have to gohopefully you will find a doctor who knows enough about nutrition to helpyou change your risk factors for both diseases as part of a treatmentprogrambut the odds are that you will not and thats why im here whenmy wife detected a lump in here breast i didnt say dont worry my vitamine will take care of it any breast lump has to be worked up by a physicianplan and simple if its begninwhich most are fine then maybe a dietchange and supplementation will prevent further breast lumps from occuringbut let me tell you right now if you have tried diet and supplementationand another lump returns get your butt into the doctors office as fast asyour little feet can carry youbetter yet have a mammography done on aregular basis my wife kept putting hers off both myself and hergynocologist told her she needed to have one done her gynocologist evenscheduled one but she didnt show uptoo busy running the operating room forthe biggest hospital in tulsaone more thing i am not an orthomolecular nutritionist this group useshigh dose vitamins and minerals to treat all kinds of disease there isabsolutely no doubt in my mind that vitamins and minerals can and do havedrug actions in the body but you talk about flying blind man this isreally blind treatment no drug could ever be used as these vitamins andminerals are being used im not saying that some of this stuff couldntbe right on the money it may well be but my approach to nutrition is alot like that of weinsier and morgan the two mds who wrote the newclinical nutrition textbook my push is the nutrient reserves and the labtests needed to measure these reserves and then supplementation or dietchanges to get these reserves built up to where they should be to let youhandle stress thats where im coming from folks blast away if you wantim not going to change put me in your killfile if you want i reallydont care im averaging 810 email messages a day from people who thinkthat ive got something important to say but im also getting hit by afew with an axe to grind thats lifechromium is one of the trace elements it has a very limitedbut veryimportant role in the body it is used to form glucose tolerance factogtf gtf is made up of chromium nicinamideniacin glycine cysteineand glutamic only the chromium and the niacin are needed from the diet toform gtf some foods already have gtfliver brewers or nutritional yeastand black pepper when chromium is in gtf a pretty good absorption isseenabout 20 but when it is simply present as a mineral or mineralchelatechromium picolinate its absorption is much lower1 to 2 lowestfor all the minerals ive been posting in misc fitness and chromium hascome up there several times as a fat burner chromium is among the leasttoxic of the minerals so you could really load yourself up and not reallydo any harm i wouldnt do it though the adequate and safe range forchromium is 50 to 200ug per day the average american is getting about30ug per day from hisher diet chromium levels decrease with age and manybelieve that adult onset diabetes is primarily a chromium deficiency ican cite you several studies that have been done with glucose tolerance intype ii diabetes but im not going to because for each positive one therealso seems to be a negative one as well im convinced that the problem isbioavailability when yeastgtf is used good results are obtained but whenchromium itself is used the results are usually negative in addition totype ii diabetes chromiuum has been examined in cardiovascular disease andglucoma again with mixed results as far as cardiovascular disease isconcernesince a high blood glucose level can lead to cardiovascular diseasethis possible link with chromium isnt too surprising glucoma is a littlemore interesting muscle eye focusing activity is primarily an insulinresponsive glucosedriven metabolic function if this eye focusing activityis impairedby a lack of glucose due to a poor insulin response intraocularpressure is believed to be elevated in a fairly large study of 400 pts withglaucoma the one consistent finding was a low rbc chromium j am collnutr 1055361991 but this one preliminary study should not promptpeople to go out and start popping chromium supplements for one thingjust about every older person is going to have a low rbc chromium unlessthey have been taking chromium suppleemntsyeast since glucoma is oftenfound in older people its not too surprising that chromium was low in therbcs if chromium supplementation could reverse glucoma that wouldprompt some attention i suspect that there will be a clinical trail tocheck out this possible chromium link to glucomayou could find out what your body chromium pool size was by either the rbcchromium test or hair analysis most clinical labs are not going to run arbc chromium there are plenty of labs that will do a hair and nailanalysis for you but i wouldnt use them there is just too much funnybusiness going on in these unregulated labs right nowheres weinsier and morgan advise on chromium they do not considerchromium to be one of those minerals for which a reliable clinical test isavailablethey dont like the hair and nail analysis labs either and theyalso recognize the rbc chromium is primarily a research test that is notroutinely available in most clinical chemistry labs this has to changeand as more labs run a rbc chromiuum it will what then do they suggestmake a diagnosis of chromium deficiency based on a documented clinicalresponse to chromiumrun a glucose tolerance test before and after chromiumsupplementation once you make the diagnosis put the patient on 200ug ofcrcl3 orally each day or 10grams of yeast per daywhats my advise dont take chromium supplements to try to loose weighthey just do not work that way if you want to take them and thenexercise that would be great do include yeast as part of your dietmostamericans are not getting enough chromium from their diet if you do havea poor glucose tolerance ask your doctor to check your chromium status when he or she says what in the world are you talking about just sayplease get a copy of weinsier and morgans new clinical nutrition textbookand do what they say to do with patients who present with a poor glucosetolerance if you cant do that ill find a doctor who can thank youvery muchmarty b
