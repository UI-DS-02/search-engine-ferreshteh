my wife has requested that i poll the sages of usenet to see what i known about the use of chromium in weight control diet suppliments she has seen multiple products advertising it and would like any kin real information my first impulse was yuck a metal but i have zero data on it what do you know henry meltoni ll tell you all that i know about chromium but before i do i want toget a few things off my chest i just got blasted in e mail for my kidneystone posts kidney stones are primarily caused by diet as is heartdisease and cancer when i give dietary advise it is not intended toencourage people reading this news group or sci med nutrition where i domost of my posting to avoid seeing a doctor nothing can be further fromthe truth kidney stones can be caused by tumors and this possibility has tobe ruled out but once it is diet is a good way of preventing a reoccurancesame thing with heart disease and cancer if you suspect that you may havea problem with one of these diseases don t use what i m going to tell youor what you read in some book to avoid going to a doctor you have to gohopefully you will find a doctor who knows enough about nutrition to helpyou change your risk factors for both diseases as part of a treatmentprogram but the odds are that you will not and that s why i m here whenmy wife detected a lump in here breast i didn t say don t worry my vitamine will take care of it any breast lump has to be worked up by a physician plan and simple if it s begnin which most are fine then maybe a dietchange and supplementation will prevent further breast lumps from occuringbut let me tell you right now if you have tried diet and supplementationand another lump returns get your butt into the doctor s office as fast asyour little feet can carry you better yet have a mammography done on aregular basis my wife kept putting her s off both myself and hergynocologist told her she needed to have one done her gynocologist evenscheduled one but she didn t show up too busy running the operating room forthe biggest hospital in tulsa one more thing i am not an orthomolecular nutritionist this group useshigh dose vitamins and minerals to treat all kinds of disease there isabsolutely no doubt in my mind that vitamins and minerals can and do havedrug actions in the body but you talk about flying blind man this isreally blind treatment no drug could ever be used as these vitamins andminerals are being used i m not saying that some of this stuff couldn tbe right on the money it may well be but my approach to nutrition is alot like that of weinsier and morgan the two m d s who wrote the newclinical nutrition textbook my push is the nutrient reserves and the labtests needed to measure these reserves and then supplementation or dietchanges to get these reserves built up to where they should be to let youhandle stress that s where i m coming from folks blast away if you wanti m not going to change put me in your killfile if you want i reallydon t care i m averaging 8 10 e mail messages a day from people who thinkthat i ve got something important to say but i m also getting hit by afew with an axe to grind that s lifechromium is one of the trace elements it has a very limited but veryimportant role in the body it is used to form glucose tolerance facto gtf gtf is made up of chromium nicinamide niacin glycine cysteineand glutamic only the chromium and the niacin are needed from the diet toform gtf some foods already have gtf liver brewers or nutritional yeastand black pepper when chromium is in gtf a pretty good absorption isseen about 20 but when it is simply present as a mineral or mineralchelate chromium picolinate it s absorption is much lower 1 to 2 lowestfor all the minerals i ve been posting in misc fitness and chromium hascome up there several times as a fat burner chromium is among the leasttoxic of the minerals so you could really load yourself up and not reallydo any harm i wouldn t do it though the adequate and safe range forchromium is 50 to 200ug per day the average american is getting about30ug per day from his her diet chromium levels decrease with age and manybelieve that adult onset diabetes is primarily a chromium deficiency ican cite you several studies that have been done with glucose tolerance intype ii diabetes but i m not going to because for each positive one therealso seems to be a negative one as well i m convinced that the problem isbioavailability when yeast gtf is used good results are obtained but whenchromium itself is used the results are usually negative in addition totype ii diabetes chromiuum has been examined in cardiovascular disease andglucoma again with mixed results as far as cardiovascular disease isconcernesince a high blood glucose level can lead to cardiovascular disease this possible link with chromium isn t too surprising glucoma is a littlemore interesting muscle eye focusing activity is primarily an insulinresponsive glucose driven metabolic function if this eye focusing activityis impaired by a lack of glucose due to a poor insulin response intraocularpressure is believed to be elevated in a fairly large study of 400 pts withglaucoma the one consistent finding was a low rbc chromium j am coll nutr 10 5 536 1991 but this one preliminary study should not promptpeople to go out and start popping chromium supplements for one thing just about every older person is going to have a low rbc chromium unlessthey have been taking chromium suppleemnts yeast since glucoma is oftenfound in older people it s not too surprising that chromium was low in therbc s if chromium supplementation could reverse glucoma that wouldprompt some attention i suspect that there will be a clinical trail tocheck out this possible chromium link to glucomayou could find out what your body chromium pool size was by either the rbcchromium test or hair analysis most clinical labs are not going to run arbc chromium there are plenty of labs that will do a hair and nailanalysis for you but i wouldn t use them there is just too much funnybusiness going on in these unregulated labs right nowhere s weinsier and morgan advise on chromium they do not considerchromium to be one of those minerals for which a reliable clinical test isavailable they don t like the hair and nail analysis labs either and theyalso recognize the rbc chromium is primarily a research test that is notroutinely available in most clinical chemistry labs this has to changeand as more labs run a rbc chromiuum it will what then do they suggestmake a diagnosis of chromium deficiency based on a documented clinicalresponse to chromium run a glucose tolerance test before and after chromiumsupplementation once you make the diagnosis put the patient on 200ug ofcrcl3 orally each day or 10grams of yeast per daywhat s my advise don t take chromium supplements to try to loose weigh they just do not work that way if you want to take them and thenexercise that would be great do include yeast as part of your diet mostamericans are not getting enough chromium from their diet if you do havea poor glucose tolerance ask your doctor to check your chromium status when he or she says what in the world are you talking about just say please get a copy of weinsier and morgan s new clinical nutrition textbookand do what they say to do with patients who present with a poor glucosetolerance if you can t do that i ll find a doctor who can thank youvery muchmarty b
