avoiding mistakes is certainly highly desirable however it is alsowidely acknowledged that perfectionism is inimicable to creativityand in ordinary life perfectionism carried beyond a certain point isindicative of a psychological disorder in the extreme case a perfectionist becomes so paralyzed by all the possible mistakes he mightmake that he is unable to even leave the house in science we want to discover as much truth about the world as possibleand we also want to have as much certainty as possible about thesediscoveries usually there is some tradeoff between these two desiderata the search for scope and the search for certainty if 18th century mathematicians had demanded total rigor from newton andleibniz then there would probably be no calculus today because neitherof the two could explain calculus in a way that really made sense sincethey lacked the concept of a limit and in fact because of the lack ofa rigorous foundation they made a number of errors in their use of calculusit was only a hundred years later that weistrass was able to give a solidgrounding for the ideas of newton and leibniz nonetheless what newtonand leibniz did was undoubtedly science and mathematics gained a greatdeal more from the application of their important ideas than it lostthrough the mistakes they made dick king writes somebody writes i doubt if einstein used any formal methodology he also proposed numerous experiments which if performed would distinguish universe in which special relativity holds from one in which it does not einstein played by the rules which demand that hypotheses only be put outhere if there exists a specific experiment that could disprove themthese are not the rules according to many who post to scimed anscipsychology according to these posters if its not supported bcarefully designed controlled studies then its not sciencetaken to the extreme i believe that the attitude that empirical studiesare everything and ideas are nothing results in a complete stultificationof science for one thing an insistence on an elaborate and expensive methodologyresults in a sort of scientific tradeunionism where those outsidethe establishment and lacking institutional or corporate support haveno chance to obtain a hearing i dont in the least believe that thisis the intention of the arbiters of scientific methodology nonethelessit is one of the results and although institutional science hascertainly produced many wonderful results i think it is a foolisharrogance for scientists to believe that no one outside the establishment and using less than perfect empirical methodology will ever comewith anything worthwhile furthermore the big bucks approach to science promotes what i think ione of the most significant errors in science choosing to investigatquestions because they can be readily handled by the currentlfashionable methodology or because one can readily get institutionaor corporate sponsorship for them instead of directing attention tthose questions which seem to have fundamental significancefor instance certain questions cannot be easily investigated witstatistical methods because the relevant factors are not quantitativeone could argue that this is the case for almost all questions in manareas of psychology in my opinion a perusal of many of the paperresulting from the attempt by psychologists to force these questioninto a statistical framework gives the lie to russell turpinassertion that current scientific methods avoid all known errorsi think that asking the wrong question is probably the most fundamentalerror in science ignoring potentially valuable ideas is one of theothers and i think that scientific journals are full of alltoo many studies done with impeccable empirical methods but which areworthless because the wrong question was asked in the first place in the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists psychology seemsless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects ladyuhunixuhcchawaiiedu ladyuhunixbitne
