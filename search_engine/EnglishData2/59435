here is a press release from huntington medical research institutes new method for diagnosing alzheimers disease discovered ahuntington medical research institutes results to be reporte to national desk health write contact john lockhart or belinda gerber 3104447000 o 8005228877 for the huntington medical researc institutes los angeles april 28 a new method for diagnosingand measuring chemical imbalances in the braiwhich lead to alzheimers disease and other dementias has beediscovered by researchers at the huntington medical researcinstitutes hmri in pasadena calif results of their researcwill be reported in the may issue of the scientific journalradiology using an advanced form of magnetic resonance imaging mricalled magnetic resonance spectroscopy mrs a research team leby brian d ross md d phil conducted a study on 21 elderlpatients who were believed to be suffering from some form odementia the exams used standard mri equipment fitted with speciasoftware developed at hmri called clinical proton mrs clinicaproton mrs is easily applied giving doctors confirmatory diagnosein less than 30 minutes an automated version of clinical protomrs called proton brain examination probe reduces the examinatiotime yet further providing confirmatory diagnoses in less than 1minutes by comparison the current standard of care in testinfor alzheimers disease calls for lengthy memory function anneuropsychological tests which can be very upsetting to thpatient are not definitive and can only be confirmed by autopsy in addition to alzheimers disease the new clinical proton mrexam may have applications in diagnosing other dementias includinaidsrelated dementia parkinsons disease and huntingtondisease weve developed a simple test which can be administered quickland relatively inexpensively using existing mri equipment fittewith either the mrs or probe software said dr ross addingthis will help physicians to diagnose alzheimers earlier anintervene with therapeutics before the progression of the diseascauses further damage to the delicate inner workings of the brain dr ross and his hmri team measured a family of chemicals in thbrain known as inositols and myoinositol mi acted as a markein the study in comparison to healthy patients those diagnosewith alzheimers showed a 22 percent increase in mi while theilevel of another chemical called nacetylaspartate naa wasignificantly lower indicating a loss of brainstimulating neuronbelieved to be associated with the progression of the disease current drug therapy for alzheimers disease is widelconsidered to be inadequate this is attributable dr rosbelieves to the theory that alzheimers is caused by ainterruption in the transmission of the chemical acetylcholine tthe nerve cells this belief has been adhered to over the last 1years and consequently most drugs to treat alzheimers were baseon the changing receptors for acetylcholine physicians have a real need for a test to differentiatalzheimers from other dementias to provide the patient and his oher family with a firm diagnosis and to monitor future treatmenprotocols for the treatment of this disease for this reason wconsider this test a major advancement in medicine said brucmiller md a noted neurologist at harborucla mrs researcheand a coauthor of the study other members of the hmri research team included rex a moatsphd truda shonk bs thomas ernst phd and suzanne woolleyrn the probe software can be fitted on the approximately 120general electric mri units currently in use in the united statesand will be configured for other manufacturers mri units soon for interviews with dr ross advance copies of the radiologmay issue and other information please contact john lockhart obelinda gerber for hmri at 3104447000 or 8005228877 q a on alzheimers disease what is alzheimers disease and how is it caused alzheimers disease ad is an incurable degenerative disease othe brain first described in 1906 by the german neuropathologisalois alzheimer as the disease progresses it leads to loss omemory and mental functioning followed by changes in personalityloss of control of bodily functions and eventually death how many people does it affect alzheimers disease affects an estimated 4 million adults ithe united states and is the fourth leading cause of death takinapproximately 100000 lives each year while alzheimerdebilitates its victims it is equally devastating botemotionally and financially for patients families ad is thmost common cause of dementia in adults symptoms worsen everyear and death usually occurs within 10 years of initial onset what are its signs and symptoms although the cause of ad is not known two risk factors havbeen identified advanced age and genetic predisposition the risof developing ad is less than one percent before the age of 5yars old but increases steeply in each successive decade of lifto reach 30 percent by the age of 90 in patients with familiaad immediate family relatives have a 50 percent chance odeveloping ad one of its first symptoms is severe forgetfulnesscaused by shortterm memory loss dr herman weinreb of the schooof medicine at new york university says whether forgetfulness ia serious symptom or not is largely a matter of degree ansuggests the following criteria forgetting the name of someone you see infrequently i normal forgetting the name of a loved one is serious forgetting where you left your keys is normal forgetting how to get home is serious doctors suggest that people with severe symptoms should bevaluated in order to rule out alzheimers disease and other formof dementia 30canada remote systems toronto ontari4166297000629704
