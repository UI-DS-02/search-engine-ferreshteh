i had allergy shots for about four years starting as a sophomore in higschool before that i used to get bloody noses nighttime asthma attacksand eyes so itchy i couldnt get to sleep after about 6 months on thshots most of those symptoms were gone and they havent come back stopped getting the shots due more to laziness than planning in collegemy allergies got a little worse after that but are still nowhere near abad as they used to be so yes the shots do work
