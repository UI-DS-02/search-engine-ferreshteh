i don t think extra scientific is a very useful phrase in a discussio of the boundaries of science except as a proposed definiens extra rationa is a better phrase in fact there are quite a number of well known case of extra rational considerations driving science in a useful direction yeah but the problem with holding up the extra rational examples a exemplars or as refutations of well founded methodology is that yo run smack up against such unuseful directions as lysenko such extra rational cases are curiosities not guides to methodologyas has been noted before there is the distinction between motivationand method no experimental result should be accepted unless it idescribed in sufficient detail to be replicated and the replicationdo indeed reproduce the result no theoretical argument should baccepted unless it is presented in sufficient detail to be followed anreasonable knowlegeable people agree with the force of the logicbut people try experiments and pursue arguments for all sorts of crazreasons irrational motivations are not just curiousities they are large part of the history of sciencethere are a couple of negative points to make here1 a theory of qi could conceivably become accepted without direcverification of the existence of qi for example quarks are an acceptepart of the standard model of physics with no direct verification whawould be needed would be a theory based on qi that predicted medicareality better than the alternatives the central theoretical claim coullie forever beyond experiment as long as there was a sufficient body oexperimental data that the qi theory predicted better than any other i wouldn t hold my breath waiting for the triumph of qi thoughi don t think that there is even a coherent theory based on it much lesa theory that explains anything at all better than modern biology and iis hard to imagine a qi theory that would not predict some way of rathedirectly verifying the existence of qi 2 science has not historically progressed in any sort of rationaexperiment data theory sequence most experiments are carried out aninterpreted in pre existing theoretical frameworks the theoreticacontroversies of the day determine which experiments get done overallthere is a huge messy affair of personal jealousies crazy motivationspetty hatreds and the like that determines which experiments and whiccomputations get done what keeps it going forward is the criticafunction of science results don t count unless they can be replicatedthe whole system is a sort of mechanism for generate and test the generatpart can be totally irrational as long as the test part works properlypasteur could believe whatever he liked about chemical activity and crystalsbut even mitscherlich had to agree that racemic acid crystals were handedthat when you separate them by handedness you get two chemicals that rotatpolarized light in opposite directions and the right rotating version waindistinguishable from tartaric acid pasteur s irrational motivation haled to a replicable and important resultthis is where lysenko creationists etc fail they have usually noeven produced coherent theories that predict much of anything when theitheories do predict and are contradicted by experiment they do noconcede the point and modify their theories rather they try to suppresthe results lysenko or try to divert attention to other evidence thethink supports their position creationists mark a fulk t t tuniversity of rochestecomputer science department tfulk cs rochester ed
