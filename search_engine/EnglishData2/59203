banschbach vms ocom okstate edu wrote a friend has what is apparently a fairly minor case of crohn disease but she can t seem to eat certain foods such as fresh vegetables without discomfort and of course she wants to avoid a recurrence her question is are there any nutritionists who specialize in th problems of people with crohn s disease i saw the suggestion of lipoxygnase inhibitors like tea and turmeric thanks in advance john eyle all your friend really has to do is find a registered dietician rd while most work in hospitals and clinics many major cities will have rd s who are in private practice so to speak many physicans will refer their patients with crohn s disease to rd s for dietary help if you can get your friend s physician to make a referral medical insurance should pay for the rd s services just like the services of a physical therapist the better medical insurance plans will cover this but even if your friend s plan doesn t it would be well worth the cost to get on a good diet to control the intestinal discomfort and help the intestinal lining heal crohn s disease is an inflammatory disease of the intestinal lining and lipoxygenase inhibitors may help by decreasing leukotriene formation but i m not aware of tea or turmeric containing lipoxygenase inhibitors for bad inflammation steroids are used but for a mild case the side effects are not worth the small benefit gained by steroid use upjohn is developing a new lipoxygenase inhibitor that should greatly help deal with inflammatory diseases but it s not available yet marty b be sure a dietician is up to date on crohn s and ulcerative colitis previously low residue diets were recommended but this advice hanow changed also there will be differences in advice in patients witand without obstructuon remaining so input by the physician will beimportant i find the dietician very important in my practice andi send most of my patients to a dietician in the course of seeinthem since dieticians know so much better how to get diet historieand evaluate the contents of a diet than i dosteve hollan
