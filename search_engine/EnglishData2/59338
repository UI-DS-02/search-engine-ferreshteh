marty you ve also changed the terrain of the discussion from empiri itraconazole for undocumented chronic fungal sinusitis with systemi hypersensitivity symptoms noring syndrome to the yoghurt and vitami therapy of undocumented candida enteritis elaine palmer syndrome wit systemic symptoms there is significant difference between the cost an risk of these two empiric therapeutic trials are we talking about real candida infections the whole yeast connection hypothesis the efficac of routine bacterial repopulation in humans or the ability of anecdotall effective therapies challenged by a negative randomized trial to confir an etiologic hypothesis post hoc ergo propter hoc we can t seem t focus in on a disease a therapy or a hypothesis under discussion i m lostpoint 1i m beginning to see that part of the disagreements about the whol yeast issue is on differing perceptions and on differing meaningof words medical doctors have a very specific and specialized jargon necessary for precise communication within their field which i m fullcognizant of since i too speak jargonese when with my peers for thsituation in sci med many times the words or phrases used by doctors cahave a different and more specific meaning than the same word used in thworld at large causing significant miscommunication one example wordand very relevant to the yeast discussion is the exact meaning of systemic it is now obvious to me that the meaning of this word is very specific mucmore so than its meaning to a non doctor there is also the observation othis newsgroup that both doctors and non doctors come together on essentiallequal terms which when combined with the jargon issue can further fathe flames this is probably the first time that practicing doctors gereally beat up by non doctors for their views on medicine which theotherwise don t see much of in their practice except for the occasiona difficult patientpoint 2i understand the viewpoint among many practicing doctors that they will noprescribe any treatments therapies for their patients unless such treatmenthave been shown to be effective and the risks understood from well constructeclinical trials usually double blind or that such treatments therapies arpart of an approved and funded clinical trial to these doctors to do andifferently would in this belief system be unethical practice and ifollows that any therapy not on the accepted list is therefore a nontherapy it does not even exist nor does the underlying hypothesis otheory have any validity even if it sounds very plausible by extrapolatioof what is currently known anecdotal evidence has no value either froa treatment point of viewand by and large as a scientist myself i am glad that medical practicescience takes such a rigorous approach to medical treatment however aalso being a human being last i checked and having been one of those peoplthat has been significantly helped by a currently unaccepted treatment wher standard medicine was not able to help me has caused me to sit back anwonder if holding such an extreme and rigid scientific viewpoint is iitself unethical from humanitarian considerations after all the underlyinintent of the scientific approach to medicine is to protect the health othe patient by providing the best possible care for the patient so thpatient should come first when considering treatmentwhat we need is a slightly modified approach to treatment that satisfies botthe scientific and the humanitarian viewpoints in an earlier post outlined a crazy idea for doing just that the gist of it was to give anphysician freedom and encouragement by the medical community to prescribalternate not yet proven therapies maybe supported by anecdotal evidencefor patients who all avenues of accepted therapies have been exhauste and not until then the patient would be fully informed that suctherapies treatments are not supported by the proper clinical trials and thathere are real potential risks with real possibilities of no benefit derivefrom themthis approach satisfies the need for scientific rigor it also satisfiethe humanitarian needs of the patient and the reality is that many patientwho have reached a dead end in the treatment of their symptoms using acceptemedicine will go outside the orthodox medical community either to thdoctors who are brave enough to prescribe such treatments at the risk of losintheir license or worse to non doctors who have not had the proper medicatraining this approach also recognizes this reality and keeps the contromore within orthodox medicine with the benefits that the information gleanecould help focus limited resources towards future clinical trials in the mosproductive way everybody wins in this admittedly rose colored approach i sure there are real problems with this approach as well it is presentemore as a strawman to stimulate discussionhopefully what i write here may give the sci med doctors a better idea as twhy i am open to alternative therapies as well as why i have readifficulty read apparent hostility with the coldness of the 99 9 pur scientific approach to medicine i believe the best approach to medicatreatment is one where both the humanitarian aspects are balanced with anby the scientific aspects anything else is just not good medicine imhojust my nf leanings i guess commentsjon norin charter member infj clubif you re dying
