a student told me today that she has been diagnosed with kidney stones cyst on one kidney and a kidney infection she was upset because he condition had been misdiagnosed since last fall and she has been ill al this time during her most recent doctor s appointment at her parents hmo clinic she said that about forty x rays were made of her kidney when she asked why so many x rays were being made she was told by technician that they need to see the area from different views but sh says that about five x rays were made from each angle she couldn t hel feeling that something must be wrong with the procedure or something sh is a pre med student and feels she could have understood what wa happening if someone would have explained when nobody would she go worried talso she is told that thre are 300 surgery patients ahead of he and that they cannot do surgery until august or so it is now april she is supposed to rest a lot and drink fluids but she has to go t classes she wonders why they have given her no medicine she plans t call back her doctor s office clinic and try to get answers to thes questions but i told her i would also write in to sci med and see what could find out about why there were so many x rays and whether it seem o k to wait in line 3 or more months for surgery for something like thi or whether she should be looking elsewhere for her care she does plan t get a second opinion too ti will pass info on to her it never hurts to get informatio from more than one source you can e mail me or post thanks alicmy opinion for what it s worth is that 40 x rays is way too many guidleines have been set on the number of dental x rays and chest x raysthat one should have over a given period of time because of all theenvironmental factors that can cause cancer in humans ionizing radiationis one of the most potent splits dna and causes hydroxyl free radicalformation in tissue cells ultasound like that used in seeing the fetusin the uterus has been shown to be extremely good at picking up tumorsin the prostate and gallstones in the gallbladder but kidney tissue maybe too dense for ultrasound to work for kidney stones any radiologists careto comment most stones will pass but it s a very painful process unlike gallstones i don t think that there are many drugs that can help dissolve thekidney stone which is probably calcium oxalate vitamin c and magnesiumhave worked in rabbits to remove calcium from calcified plaques in theaterial wall i have no idea if a diet change or supplementation couldspeed up the process of kidney stone passage but i m pretty confident thata diet change and or supplementation can prevent a reoccurance if surgeryis being contemplated the stone must be in the kidney tubule a secondopinion is a good idea because there are better less damaging ways to breakup the stone if it s logged within the kidney sonic blasts hmo s arenotorious for conservative care and long waits for expensvie treatments my condolences to your friend marty b
