introduction to molecular biology for computer scientists prof mick noordewier rutgers universitythis overview of the essential facts of molecular biology isintended as an introduction to the field for computer scientistswho wish to apply their tools to this rich and complex domain material covered will include structural and informationalmolecules the basic organization of the cell and of geneticmaterial the central dogma of gene expression and selectedother topics in the area of structure function and regulation asrelates to current computational approaches dr noordewier hasappointments in both computer science and biology at rutgers andhas extensive experience in basic biological research in additionto his current work in computational biology1200245pm introduction to artificial intelligence for biologists dr richard lathrop mit arris corpan overview of the field of artificial intelligence will bepresented as it relates to actual and potential biologicalapplications fundamental techniques symbolic programminglanguages and notions of search will be discussed as well asselected topics in somewhat greater detail such as knowledgerepresentation inference and machine learning the intendedaudience includes biologists with some computational backgroundbut no extensive exposure to artificial intelligence drlathrop codeveloper of ariadne and related technologies hasworked in the area of artificial intelligence applied tobiological problems in both academia and industry300545pm neural networks statistics and information theory in biological sequence analysis dr alan lapedes los alamos national laboratorythis tutorial will cover the most rapidlyexpanding facet ofintelligent systems for molecular biology that of machinelearning techniques applied to sequence analysis closelyinterrelated topics to be addressed include the use of artificalneural networks to elicit both specific signals and generalcharacteristics of sequences and the relationship of suchapproaches to statistical techniques and informationtheoreticviews of sequence data dr lapedes of the theoreticaldivision at los alamos has long been a leader in the use of suchtechniques in this domain300545pm genetic algorithms and genetic programming prof john koza stanford universitythe genetic algorithm an increasingly popular approach to highlynonlinear multidimensional optimization problems was originallyinspired by a biological metaphor this tutorial will cover boththe biological motivations and the actual implementation andcharacteristics of the algorithm genetic programming anextension wellsuited to problems where the discovery of the sizeand shape of the solution is a major part of the problem willalso be addressed particular attention will be paid tobiological applications and to identifying resources and softwarethat will permit attendees to begin using the methods dr kozaa consulting professor of computer science at stanford has taughtthis subject since 1988 and is the author of a standard text inthe field300545pm linguistic methods in sequence analysis prof david searls university of pennsylvania shmuel pietrokovski weizmann instituteapproaches to sequence analysis based on linguistic methodologiesare increasingly in evidence these involve the adaptation oftools and techniques from computational linguistics for syntacticpattern recognition and gene prediction the classification ofgenetic structures and phenomena using formal language theory theidentification of significant vocabularies and overlapping codesin sequence data and sequence comparison reflecting taxonomic andfunctional relatedness dr searls who holds research facultyappointments in both genetics and computer science at pennrepresents the branch of this field that considers higherordersyntactic approaches to sequence data while shmuel pietrokovskihas studied and published with prof edward trifinov in the areaof wordbased analyses
