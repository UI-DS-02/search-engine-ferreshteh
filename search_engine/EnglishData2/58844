flights of fancy and other irrational approaches are common the crucia thing is not to sit around just having fantasies they aren t of any us unless they make you do some experiments i ve known a lot of scientist whose fantasies lead them on to creative work usually they won t admi out loud what the fantasy was prior to the consumption of a few beers simple example warren jelinek noticed an extremely heavy band on a dn electrophoresis gel of human alu fragments he got very excited hoping tha he d seen some essential part of the control mechanism for eukaryoti genes this fantasy led him to sequence samples of the band and carry ou binding assays the result was a well conserved 400 or so bp sequencbut why do you characterize this as a flight of fancy or a fantasy while i am unfamiliar with the scientific context here it appears obviouthat his speculation for lack of a better or more neutral word waat least in significant part a consequence of his knowledge of and acceptancof current theory coupled with his observations it would appear thasomething quite rational was going on as he attempted to fit his observatiointo that theory or to tailor the theory to cover the observation thidoes not seem like an example of what most would normally call a flight ofancy or a fantasy it is not clear to me what you mean by rational vs irrational perhap you can give a few examples of surprising experiments that were tried ou for perfectly rational reasons or interesting new theories that were firs advanced from logical grounds the main examples i can think of are fro modern high energy physics which is not typical of science as a wholewell i think someone else in this thread was the first to use the word also extra scientific etc nor am i prepared to give a general account orationality in terms of examples there is some danger of beginning to quibblover what a surprising experiment is what counts as surprising etcthe same may be said about logical grounds my point is that quite frequentl perhaps even most frequently the roots of a new theory can be traced tpreviously existing theories or even to previously rejected hypotheses osome other theory or domain i would offer some rather well known examplesuch as toricelli s puy de dome experiment done for the sake of his sea of airhypothesis was this theory and the resulting experimental test surprising well given the prior explanations of the phenomena involved it certainly musbe counted as so was the theory constructed and the experiment designedout of perfectly rational grounds well there was a pretty successful anwell know theory of fluids the analogy to fluids by toricelli is explicitthe novelty was in thinking of air as a fluid but this was quite a noveltat the time was the theory interesting yes was it new well oncould argue that it was merely the extension of an existing theory to a nedomain but i think this begs certain questions we can debate that if yolike gary h merrill principal systems developer c compiler developmentsas institute inc sas campus dr cary nc 27513 919 677 800sasghm theseus unx sas com mcnc sas sasgh
