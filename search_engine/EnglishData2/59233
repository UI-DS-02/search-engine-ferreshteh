i recall reading somewhere during my youth in some science popularizatiobook that whyle isotope changes dont normally affect chemistry a consumptioof only heavy water would be fatal and that seeds watered only with heavwater do not sprout does anyone know about thisi also heard this i always thought it might make a good eposide ocolumbo for someone to be poisoned with heavy water it wouldnshow up in any chemical testno one else seems to know so ill post thisthis topic came up on sciphysicsfusion shortly after the coldfusioflap started as i recall its been done to some experimental micethey showed various ill effects and eventually died the reason ithat deuterium does not have exactly the same reaction rates ahydrogen due to its extra mass which causes lower velocity boltzmaconstant mumble this throws various bits of body biochemistry ouof kilter and you get sick and dieive never heard of anyone being poisened this way in or out of realife the process takes quite a while if anyone wants to write thibook i would imagine you would have to1 replace a significant fraction of the water in the body with heav water2 wait while normal breakdown and repair processes cause othe molecules in the body to be synthesised using the deuteriumduring this process the victim would gradually deteriorate aneventually die but i imagine it would take weeks during which thpoisoner would have to ensure that a significant proportion of thwater the victim ingested was heavyyou would get such a mess of symptoms that the doctors would be botalarmed and confused why should every organ in the body suddenlbegin to deteriorate if you can figure out how the poisoner gets thheavy water into the victim in a hospital then you could have a reastory herecome to think of it 2 would continue even after the heavy water wano longer being ingested so hospitalisation might be too latethe most detectable effect would be that the victims body fluidwould literally be heavy water has a molecular weight of 18 anheavy water has a mw of 20 thus the victims weight will increase babout 1 for every 10 of body water replaced by heavy water maybthe detection occurs because some pathologist in the lab notices thathe victims urine is strangely dense is there any medical tesinvolving the specific gravity of a body fluidpaulpaul johnson pajgecmrccoukt tel 44 245 73331 ext 324these ideas and others like them can be had gecmarconi research is nofor 002 each from any reputable idealist responsible for my opinion
