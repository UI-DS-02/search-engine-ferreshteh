explain i thought there were 3 types of cones equivalent to rgbyoure basically right but i think there are just 2 types one isensitive to red and green and the other is sensitive to blue and yellowthis is why the two most common kinds of colorblindness are redgreen anblueyellowyes i remember that now well in that case the cones are indeecolor sensitive contrary to what the original respondent had claimedtim not sure who the original respondent was but treiterate cones respond to particular portions of the spectrum jusas rods respond to certain parts of the visible spectrum bluegreein our case reddish in certain amphibia just as the hoseshoe cralimulus polyphemus photoreceptors respond to a certain portion othe spectrum etc it is a common misconception to confound wavelengtspecificity with being color sensitive however the two are nosynonymoustso in sum and to beat a dead horset1 when the outputs of a cone are matched for number oabsorbed photons irrespective of the absorbed photons wavelengththe cone outputs are indistinguishablet2 cones are simply detectors with different spectrasensitivities and are not any more color sensitive than are rodsommatidia or other photoreceptorst3 color vision arises because outputs of receptors whicsample different parts of the spectrum cones in this case arprocessed centrally the handwave is intentionaltive worked and published research on rods and cones for ove10 years so the adherence to the belief that cones can detect coloris frustrating but dont take my word for it im reposting a feexcellent articles together with two rather good but oldish colovision textsthe textsrobert boynton 1979 human color vision holt rhiehart and winstoleo m hurvich 1981 color vision sinauer associatesthe original articlesbaylor and hodgkin 1973 detection and resolution of visual stimuli bturtle phoreceptors j physiol 234 pp163198baylor lamb and yau 1978 reponses of retinal rods to single photonsj physiol 288 pp613634schnapf et al 1990 visual transduction in cones of the monkemacaca fascicularis j physiol 427 pp681713edwin barkdolbarkdolllepomispsychupennedeb3worldstdcoedwin barkdoleb3worldstdco
