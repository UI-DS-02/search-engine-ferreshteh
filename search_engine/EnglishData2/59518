in a previous article banschbach vms ocom okstate edu says least a few enlightened physicians practicing in the u s it s really too bad that most u s medical schools don t cover nutrition because if they did candida would not be viewed as a non disease by so many in the medical profession case western reserve med school teaches nutrition in its own section a well as covering it in other sections as they apply i e b1 deficiency in neuro as a cause of neuropathy b12 deficiency i hematology as a cause of megaloblastic anemia yet i sil hold the viewpoint of mainstream medicine candida can caus mucocutaneous candidiasis and in already very sick patient with damaged immune systems like aids and cancer patients systemic candida infection i think the yeast connection i a bunch of hooey what does this have to do with how wel nutrition is taught anywayelisabeth let s set the record straight for the nth time i have not read the yeast connection so anything that i say is not due to brainwashingby this hated book it s okay i guess to hate the book by why hate meelisabeth i m going to quote from zinsser s microbiology 20th editiona book that you should be familiar with and not hate candida speciescolonize the mucosal surfaces of all humans during birth or shortlythereafter the risk of endogenous infection is clearly ever present indeed candidiasis occurs worldwide and is the most common systemicmycosis neutrophils play the main role in preventing a systemicinfection candidiasis so you would have to have a low neutrophil count or sick neutrophils to see a systemic infection poor diet and persistentparasitic infestation set many third world residents up for candidiasisyour assessment of candidiasis in the u s is correct and i do not disputeitwhat i posted was a discussion of candida blooms without systemicinfection these blooms would be responsible for local sites of irritatio gi tract mouth vagina and sinus cavity knocking down the bacterialcompetition for candida was proposed as a possible trigger for candidablooms let me quote from zinsser s again however some factors such asthe use of a broad spectrum antibacterial antibiotic may predispose toboth mucosal and systemic infections i was addressing mucosal infection i like the term blooms better the nutrition course that i teach coversthis effect of antibiotic treatment as well as the cure i guess thatyour nutrition course does not too bad here is a brief primer on yeast yeast infections as they are commonly called are not truely caused by yeasts the most common organism responsibl for this type of infection is candida albicans or monilia which is actually a yeast like fungus well maybe i m getting picky but i always thought that a yeas was one form that a fungus could exist in the other being th mold form many fungi can occur as either yeasts or molds depending on environment candida exibits what is known a reverse dimorphism it exists as a mold in the tissue but exists as a yeast in the environment should we mayb call it a mold infection a fungus infection maybe w should say it is caused by a mold like fungus martin banschbach ph d professor of biochemistry and chairma department of biochemistry and microbiolog osu college of osteopathic medicin 1111 west 17th st tulsa ok 7410 you re the chairman of biochem and micro and you didn t know that a yeast is a form of a fungus shudder or maybe you did know and were oversimplifyingmy my elisabeth do i detect a little of steve dyer in you if younoticed my faculty rank i m a biochemist not a microbiologistcandida is classifed as a fungus according to zinsser s but as you pointout it displays dimorphism it is capable of producing yeast cells pseudohyphae and true hyphae elisabeth you are probably a microbiologistand that makes a lot of sense to you to a biochemist it s a lot ofgreek so i called it a yeast like fungus go ahead and crucify meyou know elisabeth i still haven t been able to figure out why such a smalllittle organism like candida can bring out so much hostility in people insci med and i must admitt that i got sucked into the mud slinging tooi keep hoping that if people will just take the time to think about whati ve said that it will make sense i m not asking anyone here to buy into the yeast connection book because i don t know what s in that book plainand simple and to be honest with you i m beginning to wish that it was neverwrittenmarty b
