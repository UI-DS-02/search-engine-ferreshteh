i dont understand the assumption that because something is found t be carcinogenic that it would not be legal in the us i think tha naturally occuring substances excluding controlled substances ar pretty much unregulated in terms of their use as food food additive or other consumption its only when the chemists concoct sp a ingredient that it falls under fda regulations otherwise if they really looked closely they would find a reason to ban almost everything how in the world do you suppose its legal to consume tobacco product which probably should be bannedno there is something called the delany amendment which makes carcinogenifood additives illegal in any amount this was passed by congress in th1950s before stuff like mass spectrometry became available which increasedetectable levels of substances by a couple orders of magnitudethis is why things like cyclamates and red 2 were banned they are verweakly carcinogenic in huge quantities in rats so under the act they arbannedthis also applies to natural carcinogens some of you might remember time back in the 1960s when root beer suddenly stopped tasting so goodand never tasted so good again that was the time when safrole was bannedthis is the active flavoring ingredient in sassafras leavesif it were possible to market a root beer good like the old days someonwould do it in order to make money the fact that no one does it indicatethat enforcement is still in effectan odd exception to the rule seems to be the product known as gumbo filethis is nothing more than coarsely ground dried sassafras leaves thiis not only a natural product but a natural product still in its naturaform so maybe thats how they evade delany or maybe a special exemptiowas made to appease powerful louisiana democrats
