marty youve also changed the terrain of the discussion from empiriitraconazole for undocumented chronic fungal sinusitis with systemihypersensitivity symptoms noring syndrome to the yoghurt and vitamitherapy of undocumented candida enteritis elaine palmer syndrome witsystemic symptoms there is significant difference between the cost anrisk of these two empiric therapeutic trials are we talking about realcandida infections the whole yeast connection hypothesis the efficacof routine bacterial repopulation in humans or the ability of anecdotalleffective therapies challenged by a negative randomized trial to confiran etiologic hypothesis post hoc ergo propter hoc we cant seem tfocus in on a disease a therapy or a hypothesis under discussion im lostpoint 1im beginning to see that part of the disagreements about the wholyeast issue is on differing perceptions and on differing meaningof words medical doctors have a very specific and specialized jargonnecessary for precise communication within their field which im fullcognizant of since i too speak jargonese when with my peers for thsituation in scimed many times the words or phrases used by doctors cahave a different and more specific meaning than the same word used in thworld at large causing significant miscommunication one example wordand very relevant to the yeast discussion is the exact meaning of systemicit is now obvious to me that the meaning of this word is very specific mucmore so than its meaning to a nondoctor there is also the observation othis newsgroup that both doctors and nondoctors come together on essentiallequal terms which when combined with the jargon issue can further fathe flames this is probably the first time that practicing doctors gereally beat up by nondoctors for their views on medicine which theotherwise dont see much of in their practice except for the occasionadifficult patientpoint 2i understand the viewpoint among many practicing doctors that they will noprescribe any treatmentstherapies for their patients unless such treatmenthave been shown to be effective and the risks understood from wellconstructeclinical trials usually doubleblind or that such treatmentstherapies arpart of an approved and funded clinical trial to these doctors to do andifferently would in this belief system be unethical practice and ifollows that any therapy not on the accepted list is therefore a nontherapy it does not even exist nor does the underlying hypothesis otheory have any validity even if it sounds very plausible by extrapolatioof what is currently known anecdotal evidence has no value either froa treatment pointofviewand by and large as a scientist myself i am glad that medical practicescience takes such a rigorous approach to medical treatment however aalso being a human being last i checked and having been one of those peoplthat has been significantly helped by a currently unaccepted treatment wherstandard medicine was not able to help me has caused me to sit back anwonder if holding such an extreme and rigid scientific viewpoint is iitself unethical from humanitarian considerations after all the underlyinintent of the scientific approach to medicine is to protect the health othe patient by providing the best possible care for the patient so thpatient should come first when considering treatmentwhat we need is a slightly modified approach to treatment that satisfies botthe scientific and the humanitarian viewpoints in an earlier post outlined a crazy idea for doing just that the gist of it was to give anphysician freedom and encouragement by the medical community to prescribalternate not yet proven therapies maybe supported by anecdotal evidencefor patients who all avenues of accepted therapies have been exhausteand not until then the patient would be fully informed that suctherapiestreatments are not supported by the proper clinical trials and thathere are real potential risks with real possibilities of no benefit derivefrom themthis approach satisfies the need for scientific rigor it also satisfiethe humanitarian needs of the patient and the reality is that many patientwho have reached a deadend in the treatment of their symptoms using acceptemedicine will go outside the orthodox medical community either to thdoctors who are brave enough to prescribe such treatments at the risk of losintheir license or worse to nondoctors who have not had the proper medicatraining this approach also recognizes this reality and keeps the contromore within orthodox medicine with the benefits that the information gleanecould help focus limited resources towards future clinical trials in the mosproductive way everybody wins in this admittedly rosecolored approach isure there are real problems with this approach as well it is presentemore as a strawman to stimulate discussionhopefully what i write here may give the scimed doctors a better idea as twhy i am open to alternative therapies as well as why i have readifficulty read apparent hostility with the coldness of the 999 purscientific approach to medicine i believe the best approach to medicatreatment is one where both the humanitarian aspects are balanced with anby the scientific aspects anything else is just not good medicine imhojust my nf leanings i guess commentsjon norincharter member infj clubif youre dying to know what infj
