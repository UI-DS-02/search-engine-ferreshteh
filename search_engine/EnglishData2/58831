surprise surprise different people react differently to different things on slightly off the subject case in point my brother got stung by a bee i kno he is allergic to bee stings but that his reaction is severe localize swelling not anaphylactic shock i could not convince the doctors of that however because that s not written in their little rule book of course bee venom isn t a single chemical could be your brother i reacting to a different component than the one that causes anaphylactic shoc in other peoplehmmm the last time i got stung by a bee i experienced the same reactiothe first poster s brother did we went off to the doctor to see if should worry about the fact that my foot was now about 3 times it s normasize and itched ow he basically said i shouldn t this time buthat bee sting allergy was not something you tended to get aclimatized tobut were something that each time got progressively worse generally and thanext time could be the time i go into anaphylactic shock admittedly thiwas many years ago when i was young since then i just make sure i don get stung i also should carry a bee sting kit with me but i don t this isn t scientific or proof but this would lead me to believe it s not different reaction just a different degree of reaction allergies worthat way people have various reactions sort of like diabetes sompeople can get by with just monitoring their diet others have to monitotheir diet and use insulin sometimes while others have to watch their dielike a hawk and use insulin regularly i think msg is probably similar some people have allergic reactions tit some people are allergic to fermented things and can t use sosauce but the chinese have been using it for centuries that doesn necessarily mean that it s safe for everyone tjohannturner reed ed
