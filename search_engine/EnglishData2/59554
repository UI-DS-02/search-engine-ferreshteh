i ve sent gordon r my posts on protein vitamin c and vitamin a prior toposting on internet as a professional courtesy somehow i ve managed todelete my vitamin a post from my text file gordon r had promised to sendit back to me but he s pretty mad at me right now so i ll just retype itsince digging through all my references is very time consuming took me allday for that pms post i m not going to cite any references gordon r hasthem i m going to include some of the material from weinsier andmorgan s new nutrition textbook which was not in my original material topoint out that what i m going to say has some support in the medicalcommunitydiet has been know to affect the immune system of man for a very very longtime protein has always had the biggest role in infection and i vealready covered the role of protein in protecting you against infectionnow i m going to hit what i consider to be the most important nutrient inthe u s as far as infection is concerned vitamin a when vitamin a was originally discovered it was commonly referred to asthe anti infection vitamin many people linus pauling being one havedecided to take this title away from vitamin a and give it to vitamin which i ve already covered big mistake in my opinion vitamin a isalso getting a reputation as an anti cancer vitamin with good reason the nci currently has numerous clinical trials in progress to see ifvitamin a can not only prevent cancer but cure it as well it s role inboth cancer and infection is almost identical but not quite vitamin a comes in two completely different forms retinol andbeta carotene retinol is the animal form and it s toxic beta caroteneis the plant form and it s completely nontoxic both retinol and betacarotene display good absorption in the human gut if bile is presen 60 80 the liver stores all of your retinol and doles it out for othertissues to use by synthesizing retinol binding protein rbp a normal humanadult liver should have 500 000iu to 1 000 000iu of retinol stored weare born with 10 000iu in our liver u s autopsy has shown that about30 of americans die with the same or less amount of vitamin a as theywere born with if you don t believe that nutritional reserves like thatof retinol in the liver are important then this low vitamin a reserve isnot going to affect you but if you believe like i do that the nutrientreserves are important then there is a problem with vitamin a in the u sthe u s rda for vitamin a in an adult male is 1 000 re or 5 000iu ofvitamin a for adult feamles its 800 re or 4 000iu of vitamin a dietsurveys show that most americans are getting this amount of vitamin either retinol or beta carotene from their diet but the nrc nationalresearch council was going to release a new rda table in 1985 that had therda for both vitamin a and vitamin c raised c to 90mg per day and a to7 500iu per day for adult males that report and it s recommendations waskilled why concern over the increasing supplementation was the mainreason rdas are set to prevent clinical disease not to keep nutrientreserves full many scientist in the u s feel that the time has come tomove away from the prevention of clinical pathology concept and movetowards the promotion of optimum health concept especially since we havesome very good data now that show that nutrient reserves are extremelyimportant during periods of stress the nutritonal concervatives won thatbattle and a new group of scientist were collected to come out with the1989 rda list which lowered the rda for several nutrients and moved thedietary guidelines back to where they were when we first started in the1940 s get enough to prevent clinical pathology but not enough to fillthe reserves we know from autopsy that only about 10 of americans have a liver with anormal vitamin a reserve 500 000iu to 1 000 000iu i preach nutrientreserves to my students and tell them to measure them in their patientsbut for vitamin a only a liver biopsy or autopsy data will tell you howmuch somebody has stored we can tell very easily if someone hasoverfilled his or her liver with vitamin a by measuring the serium retinollevel levels above 450ug dl are highly suggestive that you have filled yourliver with vitamin a and it s time to stop taking retinol the normalrange of serum retinol will be 20 100ug dl hypervitaminosis a isdiagnosed with a serum retinol level of 2 000ug dl or higher interpretationof diagnostic test wallach m d a little brown series book this levelof vitamin a in blood means that medical attention is necessary due tovitamin a toxicity weinsier and morgan take a much more conservativeapproach to vitamin a toxicity than does wallach as you will see later inthis post between 450ug dl and 2 000ug dl you should have plentyof warning that it s time to eliminate the retinol from your diet headache redness of the skin hair loss joint pain i tell all my students that will use vitamin a in their practice that theyhad better monitor the serum retinol level and stop when there are clearsigns that the liver is full you will never really know if the patientneeds the vitamin a because you can not measure the pool in liver but youwill always know when it s time to stop just like in those vitamin a forpms studies beta carotene can be taken to fill up your liver with retinol and you willnever have to worry about toxicity because the conversion of beta carotene toretinol that occurs in both your gut and your liver will slow down stops in theliver and slows down in the gut when your liver is full of retinol buttaking beta carotene as the source of retinol takes a very long time tofill the liver up i ve seen estimates of 20 30 years if you are in the 30 that only has as much as you were born with in your liver 10 000iu oneother problem with beta carotene if you have a zinc deficit you will notconvert as much beta carotene to retinol in the gut or the liver because theenxzyme that does this conversion requires zinc in addition the release ofretinol from the liver is a zinc dependent process so a zinc deficit willcause a vitamin a deficit even if your liver has plenty of vitamin anow what does vitamin a do in cancer and infection protection the bodyuses vitamin a retinol for many different things vision the first to benailed down and where you see overt clinical pathology uses the aldehyd retinal and alcohol retinol form of vitamin a reproduction uses theretinol form and some retinal infection and cancer protection usesretinoic acid how do you convert retinol which your white blood cellsand the mucosal cells get from blood to retinoic acid you use enzymes one of which requires vitamin c this is why pauling has tried to pull thetitle of anti infection vitamin away from vitamin a vitamin c does playa role in infection interferon production for example but it s biggest roleis the conversion of retinol to retinoic acid if you increase your intakeof vitamin c you will increase your formation of retinoic acid butretinoic acid can not be converted back to retinol as retinal can and onceit s formed it s used and then lost to the body this is why the 1985 nrcgroup wanted to increase both vitamin c and vitamin a rda smost people taking large amounts of vitamin c really think that they arehelping themselves if they don t have much vitamin a in their liver andthey are not also increasing their intake of vitamin a they actually dothemselves more harm than goodretinoic acid functions in white blood cells to promote antibody formationin the mucus membrane it is the main factor in promoting good mucusproduction and a good epithelial cell barrier to prevent infectious agents fromentering the blood system the mucus membrane is referred to as the firstline defense against infection for cancer retinoic acid has been shownto act as a cell brake it counteracts the effect of cell promoters whichstimulate cells to divide cancer has two distinct steps dna alterationand cell promotion for cells that normally divide all the time promotersare not that important but for lung and breast tissue which does notnormally divide promoters are real important in the malignant processthis is the major reason why the nci has so many different clinical trialsin progress using retinol and or beta carotenechronic infection irritation of the mucus membranes is a signal thatvitamin a may not be adequate i tell my students that any patient whowalks into their office with a complaint of chronic infection has to beworked up for vitamin a along with the other factors that medicine alreadyhas on it s list of causes for chronic infection i drive this home in mycourse at the osteopathic college in tulsa when i teach at the allopathicmedical school in tulsa ou s branch campus and when i give cme lecturesdark adaptation is the best clinical test for vitamin a status since nightvision is impacted when liver reverves drop to 50 000iu of retinol theserum level of retinol can also be used but it does not drop until liverreserves drop below 10 000 to 20 000iu asking a patient if they havetrouble seeing at night is a good initial screen if cataracts are ruledout in one study done on u s spanish americans where serum retinol levelswere measured 25 of the sample population had a serum retinol level below20ug dlas more studies are done on serum retinol levels in population groups ofthe u s that have had a history of high infection rates we will probablysee a much stonger correlation between infection incidence rates and lowserum retinol levelswhat do weinsier and morgan have to say about vitamin a here are excerptfrom their bookvitamin a functions in vision in the forrm of retinol it is necessay forgrowth and differentation of epithelial tissue and is required forreproduction embryonic development and bone growth protein caloriemalnutrition and zinc deficiency may impair the absorption transport andmetabolism of vitamin a retinaldehyde is converted to retinoic acid which has biological activity in growth and in cell diferentiation but notin reproduction or vision the most common procedure to evaluate vitamin astatus is to measure the retinol level in plasma or serum the normalrange for vitamin a content for a child is 20 to 90ug dl lower values areindicators of deficiency or depleted body stores serum levels greaterthan 100ug dl are indicative of toxic levels of vitamin a dark adaptationtests and electroretinogram measurements are also useful but difficult toperform on young children rapidly proliferating tissues are sensitive tovitamin a deficiency and may revert to an undifferentiated state thebronchorespiratory tract skin genitourinary system gastrointestinaltract and sweat glands are adversely affected a daily intake of more than7 5mg about 37 000iu of retinol is not advised and chronic use of amountsover 20mg 100 000iu can result in a dry and itching skin desquamation erythematous dermatitis hair loss joint pain chapped lips hyperostoi bony depositis headaches anorexia edema and fatigue they recommend 30mg of retinol via im injection in children for vitamin adeficiency but do not discuss treatment for adults their toxic serum retinollevel is very conservative i recommend that my students try 25 000iu inadults that are having problems with chronic infection they have to ruleout a zinc deficit first by getting an rbc zinc run or if their clinicallab can t run it i tell them to do what weinsier and morgan suggest givethem the zinc along with the vitamin a at 25 000iu per day toxicityshould not be a problem and you will not have to worry about pulling thepatient into the office on a regular basis to run a serum retinolboth elaine and jon found doctors who used a much higher dose of vitamin arecall that the pms papers were using 100 000iu to 200 000iu of vitamin ai don t suggest that my students use these high doses if you wanted tofill the liver up fast as part of a clinical trial and were monitoring theserum retinol level then you would be okay but my knowledge of thevitamin a literature suggests to me that 25 000iu for patients with ademonstrated vitamin a deficit dark adapatation test or serum retinol willprovide a good and steady improvement as long as zinc and vitamin c statusare good without having to worry about toxicity if they want to get moreagressive fine if they follow my advise to check the serum retinol butvitamin a retinol should never be given in high dose to women who couldbecome pregnant since vitamin a shows teratogenicity towards the humanfetus the dose needed to show this effect on the developing fetus is18 000iu of retinol per day beta carotene will never have this effect onthe human fetuscould just taking beta carotene instead of retinol supplements help yesbut the effect will take a long time to develop my advise is to useretinol to fill the liver up and then switch to beta carotene to keep itfull vitamin a is probably one nutrient that is better off left toprescription by doctors but when we have the m d s in this newsgroupjumping all over me and other doctors that propose the use of vitamin asupplements for treating patients with chronic sinus and gi distress ithink that the most prudent option is to keep vitamin a in the otc marketbut require manufactors to provide package inserts to educate the generalpublic about the dangers of vitamin a supplementationmarty b
