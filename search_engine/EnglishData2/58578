possibly can thdifference of a day or two can mean the difference between a short recoverand a long drawnout ordeal go see a doctor now your gardenvarietdoctor may not necessarily be familiar with this sort of injury generallyany hospital with an occupational therapy clinic will offer specialists ithese kinds of problems dont wait though go see a doctorthe remainder of this information is paraphrased without permission froa wonderful report by new zealands department of labour occupationasafety and health service occupational overuse syndrome treatment anrehabilitation a practitioners guidefirst a glossary or fancy names for how you shouldnt have your handsnote youre likely to hear these terms from doctors and keyboard vendors rsi repetitive strain injury a general term for many kinds of injurie oos occupational overuse syndrome synonym for rs ctd cumulative trauma disorder another synonym for rs wruld workrelated upper limb disorders yet another synonym for rs cts carpal tunnel syndrome see below hyperextension marked bending at a joint pronation turning the palm down wrist extension bending the wrist up supination turning the palm up wrist flexion bending the wrist

abduction moving away from the body overspanning opening the fingers out widenow then problems come in two main types local conditions and diffusconditions local problems are what youd expect specific musclestendons tendon sheaths nerves etc being inflamed or otherwise hurtdiffuse conditions often mistaken for local problems can involve muscldiscomfort pain burning andor tingling with identifiable areas otenderness in muscles although theyre not necessarily the problem why does occupational overuse syndrome occur heres the theorynormally your muscles and tendons get blood through capillaries whicpass among the muscle fibers when you tense a muscle you restricthe blood flow by the time youre exerting 50 of your full poweryoure completely restricting your blood flowwithout fresh blood your muscles use stored energy until they run outthen they switch to anaerobic without oxygen metabolism which generatenasty byproducts like lactic acid which cause painonce one muscle hurts all its neighbors tense up perhaps to relieve thload this makes sense for your normal sort of injury but it only makethings worse with repetitive motion more tension means less blood flowand the cycle continuesanother byproduct of the lack of blood flow is tingling and numbness froyour nerves they need blood tooanyway when youre typing too much youre never really giving a changfor the blood to get back where it belongs because your muscles neverelax enough to let the blood through stress poor posture and pooergonomics only make things worse specific injuries you may have heard ofnote most injuries come in two flavors acute and chronic acutinjuries are severely painful and noticable chronic conditions havless pronounced symptoms but are every bit as realtenosynovitis an inflamation of the tendon sheath chronic tenosynovitioccurs when the repetitive activity is mild or intermittent not enough tcause acute inflamation but enough to exceed the tendon sheaths abilitto lubricate the tendon as a result the tendon sheath thickens getinflamed and youve got your problemtendonitis an inflammation of a tendon repeated tensing of a tendocan cause inflamation eventually the fibers of the tendon start separatingand can even break leaving behind debris which induces more friction morswelling and more pain subacute tendonitis is more common which entaila dull ache over the wrist and forearm some tenderness and it gets worswith repetitive activitycarpal tunnel syndrome the nerves that run through your wrist into youfingers get trapped by the inflamed muscles around them symptoms includfeeling pins and needles tingling numbness and even loss of sensationcts is often confused for a diffuse conditionadverse mechanical tension also known as neural tension this is wherthe nerves running down to your arm have become contracted and possiblcompressed as a result of muscle spasms in the shoulders and elsewhereamt can often misdiagnosed as or associated with one of the other oosdisorders it is largely reversible and can be treated with physiotherapybrachial plexus stretches and trigger point therapyothers for just about every part of your body theres a fancy name foa way to injure it by now you should be getting an idea of how ooconditions occur and why just be careful many inexperienced doctormisdiagnose problems as carpal tunnel syndrome when in reality yomay have a completely different problem always get a second opiniobefore somebody does something drastic to you like surgery4 typing posture ergonomics prevention treatmenthe most important element of both prevention and recovery is to reductension in the muscles and tendons this requires learning how to relaxif youre under a load of stress this is doubly important tune outhe world and breath deep and regular relaxing should become a guidinprinciple in your work every three minutes take a three second breakevery three minutes take a three second break really do it everthree minutes its also helpful to work in comfortable surroundingscalm down and relaxif you cant sleep you really need to focus on this rest sleep anrelaxation are really a big dealthere are all kinds of other treatments of course drugs can reducinflamation and pain custommolded splints can forcefully prevent baposture surgery can fix some problems exercise can help strengtheyour muscles regular stretching can help prevent injury good posturand a good ergonomic workspace promote reduced tension ice or hotcolcontrast baths also reduce swelling only your doctor can say whats besfor you posture here are some basic guidelines i so liked the way this wawritten in the new zealand book that im lifting it almost verbatim froappendix 10 dwallach let your shoulders relax let your elbows swing free keep your wrists straight pull your chin in to look down dont flop your head forward keep the hollow in the base of your spine try leaning back in the chair dont slouch or slump forward alter your posture from time to time every 20 minutes get up and bend your spine backwardset the seat height first your feet should be flat on the floor thereshould be no undue pressure on the underside of your thighs near the kneesand your thighs should not slope too muchnow draw yourself up to your desk and see that its height is comfortablto work at if you are short this may be impossible the beest remedis to raise the seat height and prevent your legs from dangling by using footrestnow adjust the backrest height so that your buttocks fit into the spacbetween the backrest and the seat pan the backrest should support you ithe hollow of your back so adjust its tilt to give firm support in thiareaif you operate a keyboard you will be able to spend more time leaninback so experiment with a chair with a taller backrest if availablenow i diverge a little from the texta good chair makes a big difference if you dont like your chair gfind a better one you really want adjustments for height back angleback height and maybe even seat tilt most arm rests seem to get ithe way although some more expensive chairs have height adjustable arrests which you can also rotate out of the way you should find a goostore and play with all these chairs pick one thats right for youin the san francisco bay area i highly recommend just chairs thname says it all keyboard drawers wrist pads and keyboard replacementsthere is a fair amount of controvery on how to get this right for sompeople wrist pads seem to work wonders however with good posture yoshouldnt be resting your wrists on anything you would prefer youkeyboard to be right there if you drop your arms at your side and thelift your hands up at the elbow you want your keyboard under your handwhen your elbows are at about 90 degrees of course you want to avoipronation wrist extension and ulnar deviation at all costs wrist padmay or may not help at this you should get somebody else to come anlook at how you work how you sit how you type and how you relax itoften easier for somebody else to notice your hunched shoulders odeviated handssome argue that the normal flat keyboard is antiquated and poorldesigned a number of replacements are available
