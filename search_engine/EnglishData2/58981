i think that part of the problem is that i have proposed definition of science that i intended to be interpreted broadland that lee lady has interpreted fairly narrowly my definitiois this science is the investigation of the empirical that avoidmistakes in reasoning and methodology discovered from previouwork lee lady writes i don t think that science should be defined in a way that some of the activities that lead to really important science namel thinking and informal exploration are not recognized a scientific work unless one classifies thinking and informal exploration as mistake they fall under my definition i hope no one woulconsider speculation thinking and informal exploration aunscientific seriously i m not sure whether i misjudged you or not in one respect i still have a major problem though with your insistence that science is mainly about avoiding mistakes here is where i think we are talking at cross purposes it is noclear to me that the kind of definition i have proposed should btaken as describing what science is mainly about considerfor example a definition of invertebrates as all animals lackina backbone this fairly tells what is an invertebrate anwhat is not an invertebrate but it hardly tells you whainvertebrates are all about one can read this definition anstill not know that 95 of all animal species are invertebratesthat invertebrates possess a remarkably broad range of form thasome invertebrate groups such as insects and nematodes arubiquitous in all ecosystems etc in short knowing thdefinition of invertebrates does not tell one what they ar mainly about the misunderstanding here is my fault i did not give sufficiencontext for people to understand my proposed definition okay so let s see if we agree on this first of all there are degrees of certainty it might be appropriate for instance to demand carefully controlled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth to the extent that there is any such thing the effectiveness of a certain treatment on the other hand highly favorable clinical experience even if uncontrolled can be adequate to justify a preliminary judgement tha a treatment is useful secondly it makes sense to be more tolerant in our standards of evidence for a pronounced effect than for one that is marginal i agree on both counts as an example of the second it would onltake a few cases of curing rabies to convince most veterinarianthat a treatment was effective despite a lack of controls as to the first i do not think it is useful to talk abou absolute scientific truth i think it is more useful to talabout the kinds of evidence that various claims have and thkinds of evidence in particular fields that in the past havproven faulty or reliable the latter is obviously a matter odegree and in each field practitioners try to discover threlevance of different kinds of evidence one of the primary mistakes that marks the advocacy of an idea apsuedo science is that the advocacy lacks any sense of proportioregarding the kinds of evidence related to the proposed claimthe kinds of evidence that are actually relevant to it and thhistorical reasons in the field that certain kinds of evidencare given more weight than others it is perfectly alright tspeculate i have read quite a few refereed papers thaspeculated left and right but the authors were careful tidentify the notions as speculative to list what little evidencwas presently available for them and to describe how researccould proceed to either put the notion on more firm footing or tuncover its problems often what distinguishes whether a papeof this sort passes muster is the thoughtfulness with which thauthor sets the context and paves the way for future work iis in this area that many proponents of speculative ideas fail the folks over in sci psychology have a hundred and one excuses not t make this simple test they claim that only an elaborate outcome stud will be satisfactory a study of the sort that nlp practitioners many of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice can ill afford to do most of them are also just plain not interested because the whole idea seems frivolous and since they re not part of th scientific establishment they have no tangible rewards to gain from scientific acceptance i think a lot of scientists steer away from things that deserving or not garner a patina of kookiness wheproponents of some practice see no value in more carefuinvestigation of that practice that sets alarms ringing in manresearchers minds this is unfortunate because there is undoubtedly somintersection between things that are worth investigating anthings that are advocated by those who seem careless ounreasonable in their advocacy on the other hand i caunderstand why many scientists would just as soon select othedirections for research as gordon banks has pointed out no onwants to become this generation s rhine one academic in sci psychology said that it would be completely unscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasn t been described in a scientific journal i think this is absurd actually at least one fairly careful academic study has been done with favorable results but it s apparently not acceptable becaus it s a doctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journali wonder why the results were not published in my fielddissertation results are typically summarized in papers that arsubmitted to journals often the papers are accepted fopublication before the dissertation is finished this certainleases one s defense finally i hope lee lady will forgive me from commenting eitheon nlp or the discussion of it in sci psychology i know littlabout either and so have nothing to offerrussel
