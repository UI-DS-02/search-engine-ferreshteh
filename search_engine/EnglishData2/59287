a from some of the replies to my original posting its evident that soma people do not secrete enough mucous to keep their nose lining protecte include small amounts of hot spicy foods with your meals it not a cure but many people find it helpful to create extra mucus you may also consider taking a few drops of iodine in juice or water consult your doctor first which is available otc in canada if you have a sedentary lifestyle exercising sometimes helpsa from environmental influences ie dry air but ive had no responsea from anyone with experience with rutin is there another newsgroup tha a might have specifics on herbal remediesa a robert alliso i tried to email you but our board is having internet problems so im not sure whether you got the information on rutin or not rutin is not a herb but part of the bioflavonoid complex you shoul generally not take rutin by itself but take the whole bioflavonoid complex instead if you dont and there are some exceptions to that youll eventually create a hesperidin deficiency which is the othe major component of the bioflavonoid complex i found out the hard way years ago when i recommended rutin after i showed deficient in patients who were not deficient in hesperidin be fore a later retest almost always showed a subsequent deficiency in hesperidin which from then on made me always add bioflavonoids to anyone that had very low levels of rutin most of the time people are equally low in rutin and hesperidin s there is really no reason to take rutin by itself but use the whol bioflavonoid complex instead i have several thousand patients taking them with many claiming that they had been helped with hemorrhoids varicose veins chronic nose bleeds aneurysms gastrointestinal bleeding due to drugs etc one patient in desperation took a whole bottle 100s in one da for his painful bleeding hemorrhoids without any ill effects they are also nontoxic in very high amounts thats why they ca be safely recommended if you are allergic to citrus fruit they ar made from their peels pine bark sources are available as well about 90 of patients tested show a bioflavonoid deficiency with the average daily dosage needed being about 1 2000mg for major complaints 4 6000mgday is common in case they cannot be taken because of their size and taste the are big and they dont taste that great a product made from pine bark extract gives you the same effect and the tablets are quit small and taste much better however the cost is about seven time higher for the equivalent effect one 25mg tablet of the pine bar extract gives you about the same effect as 1000mg of bioflavonoids the name for the pine bark product is pycnogenol some canadian brands carrying bioflavonoids are quest1000mg big bitter not chewabl swiss herbal600mg smooth easier swallowing jamieson500mg medium bitter chewable sisu25mg pycnogenol small easy swallowin give them a try and see what happensand good luck ron roth internet rn3228rosecom rosenet ron rothrosehamilton eating radium has strange results tom said brightly rosereader 210 p003228 entered at rosehamilton rosemail 210 usenet rose media hamilton 416 575536
