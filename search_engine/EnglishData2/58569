adaptable to most calendar programs tan example using batch jobs would be to submit a simple jo tthat runs at 9 30 am and warns you to take a break this wil tdepend a lot on your operating system twhile these approaches are not ideal they are a good way of forcing tyourself to take a break if you can t get hold of a suitable rsi tmanagement tool if you are techie enough you might want t twrite a version of typewatch see above for your operatin tsystem using batch jobs or whatever fits best tool digital watches with count down timer available from tvarious sources e g casio bp 100

tool they are very useful if yo tare writing reading driving or doing anything away fro ta computer which can still cause or aggravate rsi the grea tadvantage is that they remind you to break from whatever yo tare doing comments tmy own experience was that cutting down a lot on my typing led t tmy writing a lot more and still reading as much as ever whic tactually aggravated the rsi in my right arm though the lef tarm improved getting a count down timer watch has bee tvery useful on some occasions where i write a lot in a day ti have tried an old fashioned hour glass type egg timer bu tthese are not much good because they do not give an audibl twarning of the end of the time periodkeyboard remapping tools these enable you to change your keyboard mappinso you can type one handedly or with
