these are my last words on the subjecfrom lundby rtsg mot com walter f lundby writes as a person who is very sensitive to msg and whose wife and kids ar too i want to know why the food industry wants to put msg in food some people think it enhances the flavor i personally don t think ihelps the taste it makes me sick so i try to avoid it from dyer spdcc com steve dyer writes sez you such an effect in humans has not been demonstrated in an controlled studies infant mice and other models are useful as fa as they go but they re not relevant to the matter at hand which i not to say that i favor its use in things like baby food a patentl ridiculous use of the additive but we have no reason to believ that msg in the diet effects humans adverselywell i know that msg effects me adversely maybe not permanently buat least temporarily enough that i like to try to avoid the stuff from kiran village com kiran wagle writes if you don t like additives then for godsake get off the net and learn to cook from scratch sheeshexcuse me why can t people learn to cook from scratch on the net i ve gottelots of recipes off the net that don t use additivesif you like additives then get off the net and go to your locasupermarket buy lots of packaged foods and you get off the net is it to cover up the fact that the recipes are not very good or the food is poor quality yes and you buy it says something about your taste ehi don t and what happens when the companies forced to submit to your silly notion go out of business because nobody wants to buy their overpriced bad food removing preservatives directly raises food costs by reducing shelf life hey i ll pay my hard earned dollars to buy food that costs morbut does not have preservatives i choose to speak with my pocketbooin many ways from kiran village com kiran wagle you have a good point msg is commonly used in soups in bottle sauces in seasoning mixtures and in the coating on barbecue potat chips nacho cheese doritos breading for many frozen fried foods like fisand chicken etc ad naseum if msg is really the problem we should call this barbecue potat chip syndrome or maybe diner syndrome or the and other natural flavorings syndrome it s been a few yearsince i ve bought anything labelled with and other naturaflavorings from kiran village com kiran wagle the reaction came the time the msg was in the foo that was the only differenc same restaurant same ingredients how do you know this in order to demonstrate your claim you would have had to supervise th preparation on both occasions perhaps they used msg both times and lie about it perhaps once they used something that had begun to spoil an produced some bizarre toxin that you re allergic to well i had had similar reactions many times that was when i reallstarted watching carefully reaction to doritos hey guess what s ithere reaction to lawry s season salt guess what s in theri ll give you a hint i ve had enough problems with many many mandifferent products with msg that i figured out one thingunless i plan on getting sick i won t eat the stuff without mseldane and did i ever learn to read labels please note that i am not saying you are making it up i am jus trying to point out that the situation is not always as simple as i might seem which was why i started checking every time i got sick and evertime i got sick msg was somehow involved in one of the food productsand consider there were no other similar ingredients to my knowledge it might not please a medical researcher but it pleased my owpersonal physician enough for him to give me allergy medicine and mosimportantly it s enough proof for me to avoid it and enough proothat my incredibly frugal fiance didn t flinch when i literally threout or gave away all the food products in his pantry that had msg and he always flinches when there s waste but it was a simplexplanation i won t eat this stuff i won t cook with this stuff si can either throw it out or give it away from pattee ucsu colorado edu donna pattee my guess was that the spice mix on the fries contained msg probably lawry s seasoning salt i love the way that tastes i m not saying i never consume anything with msg i ve noticed that have a certain tolerance level like a small bag of bbq chips onca month or so it not a problem but that same bag of chips wilbother me if i also had chicken bouillon yesterday and lunch at one othe chinese restaurants the day before from kelley healthy uwaterloo ca catherine l kelley all that s needed now is that final step a double blind study don on humans there isn t even an ethical question about possibl harm as this is a widely used and approved food additivebut some say that only 2 of the population has a problem with msg some say it s more like 20 but let s say that it s 5 how manpeople would have to be tested that would have a problem also know i have a problem with it and i wouldn t volunteer for a testlike thanks guys but i don t want to get sick also i m sure thamost people probably have varying degrees of sensitivities adifferent times if i have a cold i m much more susceptible to threaction than when i m healthy as proven today when i m stuffy bufor some silly reason i still gave in and decided to have the bbchips from kiran village com kiran wagle because too many of you generic rhetorical you not you cathy g around calling this chinese restaurant syndrome thus suggesting to th people you complain to that you experience this only from chinese food msg is prevalent in a lot more things than chinese food thats why suggested calling this diner syndrome cathy doesn t i haven t saved all my postings but i never called i chinese restaurant syndrome and i never stated i got it only frochinese food i just thought it would be easiest to conduct mpersonal test at a chinese take out place that i knew would hold onot hold the msg i can t call up whoever makes doritos and ask theto make me one back of chips without msg on the other hand if one complains about potatoes from a mix o restaurant spice mixes i m going to believe them and if anyone says the got msg sick after eating too many barbecue potato chips at a party i really going to believe them well i believe i mentioned that in an earlier postlet s see you wrote this message adate 20 apr 1993 00 09 31 050but ondate 19 apr 1993 16 33 18 gmi wrote has anyone had an msg reaction from something other than chinese restaurant lots of times that s why it was so hard for me to pin down would probably have been easier if i d only have the reaction in certain type of restaurant but i ve had the reaction in chines restaurants and greek restaurants and italian restaurants and stea places i can tell you when a steak joint uses accent to tenderiz their meat oh and just in case anyone thinks i m prejudice against eithechinese food or asian people i m not going home to cook some chinesfood for the guy i m marrying next week incidentally his last namis wuso stop it with the
