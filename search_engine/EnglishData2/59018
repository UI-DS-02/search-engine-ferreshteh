my family doctor and the physiotherapist pt she sent me to agree that th pain in my left shoulder is bursitis i have an appointment with an orthpo i love that it s short for orthopedic surgeon apparently but while i waiting the pt is treating me she s using hot packs ultrasound and lasers but there s no improvemen yet in fact i almost suspect it s getting worse my real question is about the laser treatment i can t easily imagine wha the physical effect that could have on a deep tissue problem can anyon shed some light so to speak on the matterif it works it s only due to the heat produced by the laser philipp
