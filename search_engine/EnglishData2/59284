patients who are suffering the most seriousillnesses to get access to new drugs months or even years earlier than wouldotherwise be possible said hhs secretary louis w sullivan md the effortto accelerate fda review for these drugs has been a longterm commitment andindeed a hallmark of this administrationthese rules establish procedures for the food and drug administration toapprove a drug based on surrogate endpoints or markers they apply when thedrug provides a meaningful benefit over currently available therapies suchendpoints would include laboratory tests or physical signs that do not inthemselves constitute a clinical effect but that are judged by qualifiedscientists to be likely to correspond to real benefits to the patientuse of surrogate endpoints for measurement of drug efficacy permits approvalearlier than if traditional endpoints such as relief of disease symptoms orprevention of disability and death from the disease are usedthe new rules provide for therapies to be approved as soon as safety andeffectiveness based on surrogate endpoints can be reasonably establishedthe drugs sponsor will be required to agree to continue or conductpostmarketing human studies to confirm that the drugs effect on the surrogateendpoint is an indicator of its clinical effectivenessone new drug zalcitabine also called ddc was approved june 19 using amodel of this process for

of healt highfat highcalorie diets rapidly increase risk factors for coronaryheart disease in native populations of developing countries that havetraditionally consumed diets low in fat these findings according toinvestigators at the oregon health sciences university in portland haveserious implications for public health in both industrialized and developingcountries this study demonstrates why we can develop coronary heart disease andhave higher blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels it shows also theimportance of diet and particularly the potential of the diet to increase bodyweight thereby leading to a whole host of other health problems in developingcountries and affluent nations as well explains principal investigator drwilliam e connor head of the section of clinical nutrition and lipidmetabolism at oregon health sciences university over the past 25 years dr connor and his team have characterized thefood and nutrient intakes of the tara humara indians in mexico whilesimultaneously documenting various aspects of tarahumara lipid metabolism these native mexicans number approximately 50000 and reside in the sierramadre occidental mountains in the state of chihuahua the tarahumaras havecoupled an agrarian diet to endurance racing probably as a result coronaryheart disease which is so prevalent in western industrialized nations isvirtually non existent in their culture loosely translated the nametarahumara means fleet of foot reflecting a tribal passion for betting onkickball races in which participants run distances of 100 miles or morewhile kicking a machetecarved wooden ball the typical tarahumara diet consists primarily of pinto beans tortillasand pinole a drink made of ground roasted corn mixed with cold watertogether with squash and gath ered fruits and vegetables the tara humarasalso eat small amounts of game fish and eggs their food containsapproximately 12 percent of total calories as fat of which the majority 69percent is of vegetable origin dietician martha mcmurry a coinvestigatorin the study describes their diet as simple and very rich in nutrients whilelow in cholesterol and fat the tarahumaras have average plasma cholesterol levels of 121 mg dllowdensity lipoprotein ldlcholesterol levels of 72 mgdl and highdensitylipoprotein hdlcholesterol levels of 32 to 42 mgdl all of those valuesare in the good lowrisk range according to the researchers elevatedcholesterol and ldlcholesterol levels are considered risk factors for hearthicnet medical newsletter page 2volume 6 number 11 april 25 199disease hdlcholesterol is considered beneficial in previous studies thetarahumaras had been found to be at low risk for cardiac disease althoughable to respond to highcholesterol diets with elevations in total and ldlcholesterol clinical research center dietitian mcmurry and coinvestigator mariateresa cerqueira established a metabolic unit in a jesuit mission schoolbuilding near a community hospital in the small village of sisoguichi foodwas weighed cooked and fed to the study participants under theinvestigators direct supervision ensuring that subjects ate only foodstipulated by the research protocol fasting blood was drawn twice weeklyand plasma samples were frozen and shipped to dr connors laboratory forcholesterol triglyceride and lipoprotein analyses regular measurementsincluded participant body weight height and triceps skin fold thickness thirteen tarahumaras five women and eight men including one adolescent werefed their native diet for 1 week followed by 5 weeks of an affluent diet in this study we went up to a concentration of dietary fat that was 40percent of total calories this is the prototype of the holiday diet thatmany americans consume a diet high in fat sugar and cholesterol low infiber elaborates dr conners such dietary characteristics are reflected inthe cholesterolsaturation index or csi recently devised research dietitiansonja conner working with dr connor the csi is a single number thatincorporates both the amount of cholesterol and the amount of saturated fat inthe diet csi indicates the diets potential to elevate the cholesterollevel particularly the ldl dr connor explains the tarahumaran dietaverages a very low csi of 20 dr connors affluent diet used in the studyranks a csi of 149 the experimental design of this study reflects the importance ofestablishing baseline plasma lipid levels typical of the native diet beforeexposing subjects to the experimental diet the standard curve relatingdietary food intake to plasma cholesterol demonstrates a leveling off orplateau for consumption of large amounts of fat changes in dietary fatandor cholesterol in this range have little effect on plasma levels youmust have the baseline diet almost free of the variables you are going to putinto the experimental diet the framingham study for example did notdiscriminate on the basis of diet between individuals who got heart diseasebecause the diet was already high in fat all subjects were already eating ona plateau dr connor says after 5 weeks of consuming the affluent diet the subjects mean plasmacholesterol levels had in creased by 31 percent primarily in the ldlfraction which rose 39 percent hdlcholesterol increased by 31 per centand ldl to hdl ratios changed therefore very little plasma triglyceridelevels increased by 18 percent and subjects averaged an 8pound gain inweight according to dr connor lipid changes occurred surprisingly soonyielding nearly the same results after 7 days of affluent diet as after 35dayshicnet medical newsletter page 2volume 6 number 11 april 25 199 the increase in hdl carries broad dietary implications for industrializednations we think hdlcholesterol increased because we increased the amountof dietary fat over the fat content used in the previous tarahumara metabolicstudy in that study we saw no change in hdl levels after raising the dietarycholesterol but keeping the fat relatively consistent with native consumption in the present study we increased fat intake to 40 percent of the totalcalories we reached the conclusion in the tarahumara study that hdl reflectsthe amount of dietary fat in general and not the amount of dietarycholesterol hdl must increase to help metabolize the fat and it increasedquite a bit in this study dr connor explains low hdl in the tarahumarans is not typically an important predictor ofcoronary heart disease because they do not normally consume large amounts offat or cholesterol hdl remains an important predictor to americans becauseof their usual high fat intake dr connor recommends a diet for americans that contains less than 20percent of total calories as fat less than 100 mg of cholesterol and a csiaround 20 varying in accordance with caloric needs such a diet is low inmeat and dairy fat high in fiber dr connor also comments on recentsuggestions that americans adopt a mediterraneanstyle diet the originalmediterranean diet in its pristine state consisted of a very low intake offat and very few animal and dairy products we are already eating a lot ofmeat and dairy products simply to continue that pattern while switching toolive oil is not going to help the situation the world health organization who is focusing much attention on theemergence of diseases such as coronary heart disease in nations and societiesundergoing technological development dr connor says that coronary heartdisease starts with a given societys elite who typically eat a differentdiet than the average citizen if the pattern of afluence increases theentire population will have have a higher incidence of coronary heart diseasewhich places a termendous health care burden on a society who would like thedeveloping countries to prevent coronary heart disease so they canconcentrate on other aspects of their economic development and on publichealth measures to improve general wellbeing rather than paying forunnecessary expensive medical technology dr connors says the overall implication of this study is that humans can readily movetheir plasma lipids and lipoprotein values into a highrisk range within avery short time by an affluent excessive diet the present rate of coronaryheart disease in the united states is 30 percent less than it was 20 yearsago so a lot has been accomplished we are changing
