states 199 source mmwr 4215 date apr 23 199 cesarean deliveries have accounted for nearly 1 million of theapproximately 4 million annual deliveries in the united states since 1986table 1 the cesarean rate in the united states is the third highest among21 reporting countries exceeded only by brazil and puerto rico 1 thisreport presents data on cesarean deliveries from cdcs national hospitaldischarge survey nhds for 1991 and compares these data with previous years data on discharges from shortstay nonfederal hospitals have beencollected annually since 1965 in the nhds conducted by cdcs national centerfor health statistics for 1991 medical and demographic information wereabstracted from a sample of 274000 inpatients discharged from 484participating hospitals the 1991 cesareans and vaginal births after a priorcesarean vbac presented in this report are based on weighted nationalestimates from the nhds sample of approximately 31000 11 women dischargedafter delivery the estimated numbers of live births by type of delivery werecalculated by applying cesarean rates from the nhds to live births fromnational vital registration data therefore estimates of the number ofcesareans in this report will not agree with previously published data basedsolely on the nhds 2 stated differences in this analysis are significant atthe 95 confidence level based on the twotailed ttest with a critical valueof 196 in 1991 there were 235 cesareans per 100 deliveries the same rate asin 1990 and similar to rates during 19861989 table 1 the primary cesareanrate ie number of first cesareans per 100 deliveries to women who had noprevious cesareans for 19861991 also was stable ranging from 168 to 175in 1991 the cesarean rate in the south was 276 significantly p005higher than the rates for the west 198 midwest 218 and northeast226 rates were higher for mothers aged greater than or equal to 30 yearsthan for younger women in proprietary hospitals than in nonprofit orgovernment hospitals in hospitals with fewer than 300 beds than in largerhospitals and for deliveries for which blue crossblue shield and otherprivate insurance is the expected source of payment than for other sources ofpayment table 2 the same pattern characterized primary cesarean deliveries since the early 1970s the number and percentage of births to older womenincreased however if the age distribution of mothers in 1991 had remainedthe same as in 1986 the overall cesarean rate in 1991 would have been 233essentially the same as the 235 observed based on the nhds of the approximately 4111000 live births in 1991 anhicnet medical newsletter page volume 6 number 11 april 25 199estimated 966000 235 were by cesarean delivery of these an estimated338000 350 births were repeat cesareans and 628000 650 were primarycesareans since 1986 approximately 600000 primary cesareans have beenperformed annually in 1986 85 of women who had a previous cesareandelivered vaginally compared with 242 in 1991 of all cesareans in 1991350 were associated with a previous cesarean 304 with dystocia iefailure of labor to progress 117 with breech presentation 92 with fetaldistress and 137 with all other specified complications the average hospital stay for all deliveries in 1991 was 28 days incomparison the hospital stay for a primary cesarean delivery was 45 daysand for a repeat cesarean 42 days nearly twice the duration for vbacdeliveries 22 days or for vaginal deliveries that were not vbacs 23days in 1986 the average hospital stay for all deliveries was 32 days forprimary cesareans 52 days for repeat cesareans 47 days and for vbac andnonvbac vaginal deliveries 27 and 26 days respectivelyreported by office of vital and health statistics systems national centerfor health statistics cdceditorial note the cesarean rate in the united states steadily increased from1965 through 1986 however the findings in this report indicate that rateshave been stable since 1986 3 because there is little evidence thatmaternal and child health status has improved during this time and becausecesareans are associated with an increased risk for complications ofchildbirth a national health objective for the year 2000 4 is to reduce theoverall cesarean rate to 15 or fewer per 100 deliveries and the primarycesarean rate to 12 or fewer per 100 deliveries objective 148 postpartum complications including urinary tract and wound infections may account in part for the longer hospital stays for cesarean deliveriesthan for vaginal births 5 moreover the prolonged hospital stays forcesarean deliveries substantially increase healthcare costs for example in1991 the average costs for cesarean and vaginal deliveries were 7826 and4720 respectively the additional cost for each cesarean delivery includes611 for physician fees and 2495 for hospital charges 6 if the cesareanrate in 1991 had been 15 the year 2000 objective instead of 235 the numberof cesarean births would have decreased by 349000 617000 versus 966000resulting in a savings of more than 1 billion in physician fees and hospitalcharges despite the steady increase in vbac rates since 1986 several factors mayimpede progress toward the year 2000 national health objectives for cesareandelivery for example vbac rates substantially reflect the number of womenoffered trial of labor which has been increasingly encouraged since 1982 7of women who are offered a trial of labor 5070 could deliver vaginally 7a level already achieved by many hospitals 8 trial of labor was routinelyoffered in 46 of hospitals surveyed in 1984 the most recent year for whichhicnet medical newsletter page volume 6 number 11 april 25 199national data are available 9 when the vbac rate according to nhds datawas 57 the year 2000 objective specifies a vbac rate of 35 based on allwomen who had a prior cesarean regardless of whether a trial of labor wasattempted to reach the overall cesarean rate goal however increases in thevbac rate will need to be combined with a substantial reduction in the primaryrate one hospital succeeded in reducing the rate of cesarean delivery byapplying objective criteria for the four most common indications for cesareandelivery by requiring a second opinion and by instituting a peerreviewprocess 10 other recommendations for decreasing cesarean delivery ratesinclude eliminating incentives for physicians and hospitals by equalizingreimbursement for vaginal and cesarean deliveries public dissemination ofphysician and hospitalspecific cesarean delivery rates to increase publicawareness of differences in practices and addressing malpractice concernswhich may be an important factor in maintaining the high rates of cesareandelivery 4reference1 notzon fc international differences in the use of obstetric

date apr 23 199 the treatment and prevention of malaria in africa has become achallenging and complex problem because of increasing drug resistancealthough the risk of acquiring malaria for us citizens and their dependentsstationed overseas generally has been low this risk varies substantially andunpredictably during may 1992 the office of medical services department ofstate omsdos and cdc were notified of an increased number of malaria casesamong official us personnel stationed in kampala uganda a review of thehealth records from the embassy health unit ehu in kampala indicated that 27cases of malaria were diagnosed in official personnel from march through june1992 compared with two cases during the same period in 1991 ehu omsdos andcdc conducted an investigation to confirm all reported malaria cases andidentify potential risk factors for malaria among us embassy personnel thisreport summarizes the results of the investigation malaria blood smears from 25 of the 27 reported casepatients wereavailable for review by omsdos and cdc a case of malaria was confirmed ifthe slide was positive for plasmodium sp of the 25 persons 17 were slideconfirmed as having malaria a questionnaire was distributed to all persons served by the ehu toobtain information about residence activities use of malariachemoprophylaxis and use of personal protection measures ie using bednetsand insect repellents having window and door screens and wearing longsleeves and pants in the evening of the 157 persons eligible for the survey128 82 responded risk for malaria was not

health unit kampala uganda office of medicalsvcs dept of state washington dc malaria br div of parasitic diseasesnational center for infectious diseases cdceditorial note in uganda the increase in malaria among us personnel wasattributed to poor adherence to both recommended malaria chemoprophylaxisregimens and use of personal protection measures during a period of increasedmalaria transmission and intensified chloroquine resistance in subsaharanafrica the findings in this report underscore the need to provide initial andcontinued counseling regarding malaria prevention for persons living abroad inmalariaendemic areas preventive measures that are also important forshortterm travelers to such areas mefloquine is an effective prophylaxis regimen in africa and in mostother areas with chloroquineresistant p falciparum however in some areaseg thailand resistance to mefloquine may limit its effectiveness inafrica the efficacy of mefloquine compared with chloroquine alone inpreventing infection with p falciparum is 92 1 mefloquine is safe andwell tolerated when given at 250 mg per week over a 2year period the riskfor serious adverse reactions possibly associated with mefloquine prophylaxiseg psychosis and convulsions is low ie 1319 episodes per 100000users 2 while the risk for less severe adverse reactions eg dizzinessgastrointestinal complaints and sleep disturbances is similar to that forother antimalarial chemoprophylactics 1 doxycycline has similar prophylactic efficacy to mefloquine but the needfor daily dosing may reduce compliance with and effectiveness of this regimen34 chloroquine alone is not effective as prophylaxis in areas of intensechloroquine resistance eg southeast asia and africa in africa forpersons who cannot take mefloquine or doxycycline

participants exploredissues related to the epidemiology basic molecular virology mucosalimmunology and oral clinical presentations of hiv infection the workshop was organized by dr john greenspan and dr deborahgreenspan of the department of stomatology school of dentistry university ofcalifornia san francisco an international steering committee and scientificprogram committee provided guidance the conference drew more than 260 scientists from 39 countries includingasia africa europe central america south america as well as the unitedstates and canada support tor the workshop was provided by the nationalinstitute of dental research the national cancer institute the nationalinstitute of allergy and infectious diseases the nih office of aids researchand the procter and gamble company among the topics discussed were the epidemiology of hiv lesions ethicsprofessional responsibility and public policy occupational issues provisionof oral care to the hivpositive population salivary hiv transmission andmucosal immunity opportunistic infections pediatric hiv infection andwomens issues recommendation recommendations emerged from the workshop to define the associationbetween the appearance of oral lesions and rate of progression of hiv toestablish a universal terminology for hivassociated oral lesions to look formore effective treatments for oral manifestations to expand

1988 hiv infection was detected and reported largelyin homosexual and bisexual males intravenous drug users and hemophiliacs today more hiv infection is seen in heterosexual males and females and inchildren and adolescents while the predominant impact of hiv infection has been felt in africa amajor increase in infection rate is being seen in southeast asia as well five hundred thousand cases have been reported to date in this region and moreare appearing all the time researchers are continuing to document the epidemiology of oral lesionssuch as hairy leukoplakia and candidiasis they also are beginning to explorethe relationships between specific oral lesions and hiv disease progressionand prognosis socialpolitical issue discussion on the social and political implications of hiv infectionfocused on changing the publics attitude that aids is retribution forindiscriminate sexual behavior and drug use speakers also addressed healthcare delivery for hivinfected patients and the need to educate the publicabout what aids is and how it is acquired saliva and salivary gland conference speakers described transmission issues and the hivinhibitoryactivity of saliva the strength of which varies among the different salivarysecretions whole saliva has a greater inhibitory effect than submandibularsecretions which in turn have a greater inhibitory effect than parotidsecretions research has shown that at least two mechanisms are responsiblefor salivary inhibitory activity they attributed the hivinhibitory effectof saliva to the 1 aggregationagglutination of hiv by saliva which may bothpromote clearance of virus and prevent it reaching a target cell and 2direct effects on the virus or target cells other topics discussed were the manifestation of salivary gland diseasein hivinfected persons and current research on oral mucosal immunity pediatric issue pediatric aids recently has emerged as an area of intense interest withearly and accurate diagnosis and
