am i justified in being pissed off at this doctor last saturday evening my 6 year old son cut his finger badly with a knife i took him to a local urgent and general care clinic at 5 50 pm the t story deleted be bothered my son did get three stitches at the emergency room i m still trying to find out who is in charge of that clinic so i can write them a letter we will certainly never set foot in that clinic again the people in charge already know what kind of care they areproviding and they don t give a rat s ass about your repeat businessyou are much more likely to do some good writing to local newspapersand broadcast news shows if you do keep the letter short and to the poinso they don t discard it out of hand and emphasize exactly what yoare upset aboutit s possible that the local health department can help you complain tosomeone official but really that clinic exists for the sole purposeof generating walk in income through advertising and nothing you can dowill change them all you can hope for is to help someone else avoid themi m glad it sounds like your son did ok anywaymy opinion only of coursestev
