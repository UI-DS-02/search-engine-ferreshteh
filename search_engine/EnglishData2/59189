hiive just returned from a visit with my obgyn and i have a fewconcerns that maybe yall can help me with ive been seeingher every 4 weeks for the past few months im at week 28and during the last 2 visits ive gained 9 to 9 12 pounds every4 weeks she said this was unacceptable over any 4 week periodas it stands ive thus far gained 26 pounds also she says thatthough im at 28 weeks the babys size is 27 weeks i think shementioned 27 inches for the top of the fundus when i was 13weeks the babys size was 14 weeks i must also add that i hadan operation a few years ago for endometriosis and ive had noproblems with endometriosis but apparently it is causing me painin my pelvic region during the pregnancy and i have a verydifficult time moving and the doc has recommended i not walk ormove unless i have to i have a little handicapped sticker forwhen i do need to go outanyway thats 12 of the situation the other is that almost fromthe beginning of pregnancy i was getting sick throwing up about23 times a day and mostly it was bile that was being eliminated i told her about this i know this because i wasnt eatingvery much due to the nausea and could see the results wellnow i only get sick about once every 12 weeks and it is still bilerelated but in addition i had begun to feel movement near myupper right abdomen just below the right breast usually when iwas lying on my right side it began to get worse though becauseit started to hurt when i lay on my right side and then it hurt no matter what position i was in next i noticed that when iate greasy or fatty foods i felt like my entire abdomen hadturned to stone and the pain in the area got worse however ifi ate sauerkraut or vinegar or something to cut the fat itwasnt as much of a problemso the doctor says i have cholistatis and that i should avoidfatty foods this makes sense and because i was already awareof what seemed to me this cause and effect relationship i havebeen avoiding these foods on my own but im still able to eatfoods with ricotta cheese for instance and other low fat foods but doc wants me to be on a nonfat diet this means no meatexcept fish and chicken wo skin i do this anyway no nutsfried food cheese etc i am allowed skim milk she said ishould avoid anything sweet eg bananas also i must onlyhave one serving of something high in carbohydrates a day potatoes pasta rice she said i cant even cook vegetables ina little bit of oil and that i should eat vegetables raw orsteamed im concerned because i understand you need to havesome fat in your diet to help in the digestive process and ifim not taking in fat is she expecting the baby will take itfrom my stores and why this restriction on carbohydrates ifshes concerned about fat im not clear how much of herrecommendation is based on my weight gain and how much oncholistatis which i cant seem to find any information on sheoriginally said that i should only gain 20 pounds during theentire pregnancy since i was about 20 lbs overweight when istarted but my sister gained 60 lbs during her pregnancy andshes taken it all off and hasnt had any problems she alsoasked if any members of my family were obese which none of themare anyway i think she is overly concerned about weight gainand feel like im being punished by a severe diet she didwant to see me again in one week so i think she the diet may betemporary for that one weekwhat i want to know is how reasonable is this nonfat diet iwould understand if she had said lowfat diet since im tryingthat anyway even if she said really lowfat diet i think sheassumes i must be eating a highfat diet but really it is thatbecause of the endometriosis and the operation im not able touse the energy from the food i do eatany opinions info and experiences will be appreciated imtruly going stark raving mad trying to meet this new strict dietbecause fruits and vegetables go through my system in a fewminutes and ill end up having to eat constantly thus far idont find any foods satisfyingthanks
