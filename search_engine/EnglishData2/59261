and their salariesi hope some of you will find it as amusing as i didreprinted wo permissiontheres no cure for stupidity of poll on doctors salariesby mike royktribune media service on a stupidity scale a recent poll about doctors earningsis right up there it almost scored a perfect braindead 10 it was commissioned by some whiny consumers group calledfamilies usa the poll tells us that the majority of americans believethat doctors make too much money the pollsters also asked what a fair income would be forphysicians those polled said oh about 80000 a year would beok how generous how sporting how stupid why is this poll stupid because it is based on resentmentand envy two emotions that ran hot during the political campaignand are still simmering you could conduct the same kind of poll about any group thatearns 100000plus and get the same results since the majorityof americans dont make those bucks they assume that those whodo are stealing it from them maybe the berlin wall came down but dont kid yourself karl marx lives its also stupid because it didnt ask key questions suchas do you know how much education and training it takes tobecome a physician if those polled said no they didnt know then they shouldhave been disqualified if they gave the wrong answers theyshould have been dropped what good are their views on how mucha doctor should earn if they dont know what it takes to become adoctor or maybe a question should have been phrased this way howmuch should a person earn if he or she must a get excellentgrades and a fine educational foundation in high school in orderto b be accepted by a good college and spend four years takingcourses heavy in math physics chemistry and other lab work andmaintain a 35 average or better and c spend four more yearsof grinding study in medical school with the third and fourthyears in clinical training working 80 to 100 hours a week andd spend another year as a lowpay hardwork intern and eput in another three to 10 years of postgraduate trainingdepending on your specialty and f maybe wind up 100000 indebt after medical school and g then work an average of 60hours a week with many family doctors putting in 70 hours ormore until they retire or fall over as you have probably guessed by now i have considerablymore respect for doctors than does the law firm of clinton andclinton and all the lawyers and insurance executives they havecalled together to remake americas health care based on what doctors contribute to society they are farmore useful than the powerhappy egotripping programspewingsocial tinkerers who will probably give us a medical plan that isto health what clintons first budget is to frugality but propaganda works and as the stupid poll indicatesmany americans wrongly believe that profiteering doctors are themajor cause of high medical costs of course doctors are wellcompensated they should be americans now live longer than ever but who is responsible forour longevitylawyers congress or the guy flipping burgers ina mcdonalds and the doctors prolong our lives despite our having becomea nation of selfindulgent lardbutted tvgaping couchcabbages ah that is not something you heard president clinton orsuper spouse talk about during the campaign or since butinstead of trying to turn the medical profession into a villainthey might have been more honest if they had said let us talk about medical care and one of the biggestproblems we have that problem is you my fellow american yesyou eating too much and eating the wrong foods many of youguzzling too much hooch still puffing away at 250 a packgetting your daily exercise by lumbering from the fridge to themicrowave to the couch doing dope and bringing crack babies intothe world filling the big city emergency rooms with gunshotvictims engaging in unsafe sex and catching a deadly diseasewhile blaming the world for not finding an instant cure you and your habits not the doctors are the singlebiggest health problem in this country if anything it isamazing that the docs keep you alive as long as they do in fact i dont understand how they can stand looking atyour blubbery bods all day so as your president i call upon you to stop whining andstart living cleanly now i must go get myself a triple cheesygreasy with double fries do as i say not as i do but for those who truly believe that doctors are overpaidthere
