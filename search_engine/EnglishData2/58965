this reminds me of the last graham kerr cooking show i saw today hsmoked meat on the stovetop in a big pot he used a strange techniquid never seen beforehe took a big pot with lid and placed a tray in it made from aluminum foilthe tray was about the size and shape of a typical coffeetable ash traymade by crumpling a sheet of foil around the edgesin the tray he placed a couple spoonfuls of brown sugar a similaquantity of brown rice he said any rice will do the contents of twteabags of earl grey tea and a few cloveson top of this was placed an ordinary aluminum baskettype steamer wittwo chicken breasts in it the lid was put on and the whole assemblwent on the stovetop at high heat for 10 or 12 minuteslater he removed what looked like smoked chicken breasts what surpriseand concerns me are1 no wood chips where does the smoke flavor come from2 about 5 or 10 years ago i remember hearing that carmel colo obtained by caramelizing sugar a common coloring and flavorin agent had been found to be carcinogenic i believe they injecte it under the skin of rats or something if the results were conclusive caramel color would not be legal in the us yet it is still bein used was the initial research result found to be incorrect or what3 about 5 or 10 years ago i remember earl grey tea being implicate as carcinogenic because it contains oil of bergamot an extrac from the skin of a type of citrus fruit does anyone know whateve happened with that story if it were carcinogenic earl grey te could not have it as an additive yet it apparently continues to d sowrt natural wood smoke ive smoking a duck right now as it happensive noticed that a heavilysmoked food item will have an unpleasant tangtaste when eaten directly out of the smoker if the smoke has only recentlstopped flowing i find the best taste to be had by using dry wood chipsgetting lots of smoke right up at the beginning of the cooking processthen slowly barbequing for hours and hours without adding additional wood chipsmy theory is that the unpleasant tangy molecules are lowmolecular weighstuff like terpenes and that the smoky flavor molecules are some sorof larger molecule more similar to tar the long barbeque time aftethe initial intensive smoke drives off the lowmolecular weight stuffjust leaving the flavor behind does anyone know if my theory is correcti also remember hearing that the combustion products of fat drippinon the charcoal and burning are carcinogenic for that reason and becausit covers the product with soot and some unpleasant tanginess i only grilnondrippy meats like prawns directly over hot coals i do stuff like thiduck by indirect heat i have a long rectangular weber and i put the coalat one end and the meat at the other end the fat drops directly on thfloor below the meat and next time i use the barbeque i make the firin that end to burn off the fat and help ignite the coalsand yet another reason ive heard not to smoke or barbeque meat is thasmoked cured meat like pork sausage and bacon containnitrosamines which are carcinogenic im pretty sure this claim actuallhas some standing dont know about the othersan amusing incident i recall was the duncan hines scandal when it wadiscovered that the people who make duncan hines cake mix were puttina lot of ethylene dibromide edb into the cake mix to suppress weevilsthis is a fumigant which is known to be carcinogenicthe guy who represented the company in the press conference defendehimself by saying that the risk from eating duncan hines products every dafor a year would be equal to the cancer risk from eating two charcoalbroiled steaks what a great analogy when i first heard that mimmediate reaction was we should make that a standard unit one charcoabroiled steak would be equivalent to 05 duncansi dont understand the assumption that because something is found tbe carcinogenic that it would not be legal in the us i think thanaturally occuring substances excluding controlled substances arpretty much unregulated in terms of their use as food food additiveor other consumption its only when the chemists concoct sp aingredient that it falls under fda regulations otherwise if theyreally looked closely they would find a reason to ban almost everythinghow in the world do you suppose its legal to consume tobacco productwhich probably should be bannedtdave alletspace science engr ctrtuwmadiso
